Topics discussed:
A solved problem based on ER Model Concepts:
Consider the ER diagram shown in the figure for part of a BANK database. Each bank can have multiple branches, and each branch can have multiple accounts and loans. 
1. List the strong (nonweak) entity types in the ER diagram. 
2. Is there a weak entity type? If so, give its name, partial key, and identifying relationship.
3. What constraints do the partial key and the identifying relationship of the weak entity type specify in this diagram? 
4. List the names of all relationship types, and specify the (min, max) constraint on each participation of an entity type in a relationship type.
5. List concisely the user requirements that led to this ER schema design.
6. Suppose that every customer must have at least one account but is restricted to at most two loans at a time and that a bank branch cannot have more than 1,000 loans. How does this show up on the (min, max) constraints?

In this video, let us understand how to use ANACONDA for python. We shall see what is ANACONDA, how to use ANACONDA for python and why do we need to use ANACONDA for python. We shall also cover how to install anaconda on Mac OS. The installation would be similar for Windows and Linux systems as well.

If you are new to python, then you would probably have heard of anaconda but for a beginner it would be very confusing to know why do we need anaconda and how to use it and how is it beneficial to use anaconda over standalone python. So that is why in this video, I want to make it very clear on what is anaconda and why you should be using it.

Timestamp
00:00 Intro
00:39 What is Anaconda for python and Why do we need to use Anaconda?
03:30 How to install anaconda? Getting started with Anaconda
08:17 How to use Visual Studio code IDE with anaconda
10:05 How to create virtual environment using anaconda
12:05 How to work with different anaconda virtual environments
15:23 What are anaconda channels and how to add channels to anaconda

Anaconda is a python distribution, meaning when you install anaconda, it comes with python, a lot of python packages, tools and software which would be very essential especially if you are working in the field of data science. Anaconda also comes with conda, which is a package manager similar to pip. Conda can be used to install python packages and conda can also be used to create and manage virtual environments.
So anaconda can be treated as a bundle package which not only includes python but everything else you would need to conveniently work with python especially in the field of data science.
So we start this video by talking about what is anaconda and why we should be using it. I also mention a use case where using anaconda can be very beneficial.

Once we understand what is anaconda and why we should be using it, we then move into installing anaconda in our machine. Since I use Mac OS, the video shows how to install anaconda on Mac OS but the process would be same if you are on Windows or Linux system as well.

Once anaconda is installed, we then see how to use conda base environment. We see how to use anaconda with Visual Studio Code IDE which is also referred to as VS Code. We look at the different conda commands.
We then see how to create different virtual environments using conda command and then create specific python packages in each of our virtual environments. We then see how to work with different anaconda virtual environments in VS code.

Finally, we talk about channels in anaconda. We see what is a channel and how to add a new channel to the existing list of channels in anaconda. 

CHEAT CODE of all the ANACONDA commands used in this video:
conda (List down all conda commands)
conda list (List of all the python packages in the activated environment)
conda env list (List of all environments)
conda activate env-name (Activate environment ""env-name"")
conda deactivate (Deactivate from current conda environment)
conda create —name env-name python=3.7 (Create a virtual environment)
conda env remove —name DS-env (Remove a virtual environment)
conda install scikit-learn (Install a python package by name ""scikit-learn"")
python3 —version (Get python version in current environment)
which python3 (Get the location where python is installed)
conda config —show channels (List of all channels in anaconda)
conda config —get channels (List of all channels along with its priority)
conda config —add channels conda-forge (Add a new channel)
conda config —remove channels conda-forge (Remove a channel)

In this video, we shall understand how to connect to PostgreSQL Database from Python. We shall write a python program which will use the Psycopg2 module to connect to the PostgreSQL database and then perform some database or SQL transactions such as creating a table and then insert data to the table, updating a table data and delete records from the table using python code. We shall also see how to fetch table data from postgres database to python program.

At the end of the video, I will also cover how to use Context Manager to perform all of the above SQL operations. That is, we will use the WITH clause to connect to the database and also use the WITH clause to open the cursor. I will also mention what are the advantages of using WITH clause and why it is recommended to always use context manager or WITH clause when working with database in python.

14:30 FETCH data from PostgreSQL Table and display in Python program
17:23 UPDATE Table data in PostgreSQL database from Python program
18:50 DELETE Table record in PostgreSQL database from Python program
20:14 Using Context Manager to connect to PostgreSQL database from Python

We shall be using psycopg2 module to connect to PostgreSQL database from python, which is considered to be one of the best libraries to connect to postgres from python.

We shall start the video by covering the couple of pre-requisites which is to first install the psycopg2 module and then finding the credentials or information required to connect to the postgres database. 

After this we shall write the python program which will initially connect to the PostgreSQL database and then open a cursor which will be then used to perform the database operations like CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO Table, UPDATE Table data, DELETE table record and also how to fetch or retrieve table records or table data from the database to Python program.

Finally, we shall end the video by talking about context manager way of connecting to the database and also how to use context manager to open a cursor. Using context manager is simply using the WITH clause while connecting to the database and then also using the WITH clause while opening the cursor.
I will also mention the advantages of using a context manager over the traditional method or connecting to data and opening the cursor. And also mention why is it recommended to always use context manager when connecting to database in python.

Hopefully this video helped and gave you some useful information of using SQL within python program. If you liked it then please make sure to like the video and also subscribe to the channel.

In this video, we learn how to use logging in python. Python logging module can be used to log messages. We show why Print statement should not be used in Python for logging messages. And the advantages of using logging module over print statement in python.


This logging tutorial video also covers the different levels of logging in python. We look at DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL levels of logging in python. We explain these logging levels by writing programs and showcasing the difference in logging by setting different logging levels.


If you are new to programming, then you might consider using print statement for logging messages in Python and you may wonder why use python logging module when print can do the same things but, in this video, I give you 2 use cases of the advantages of using logging module over print in python for the purpose of logging messages.

In the beginning of this python tutorial video, we discuss how to use logging module to log messages to your console and then we also see how to log messages to a file. 
We also cover how to disable logging in python. 
We start by using the root logger which is the default logger when we use the basic configuration of logging in python. At the end of the video, we also show to create your own logger and how to create separate logger for each of your program.

We discuss why it is not recommended to use root logger and the problems of using root logger. We look at the syntax to create a unique logger for each of our program.

This video covers all the basic concepts required to get started with file handling in Python. File objects in Python can be used to read the contents of a file and also file objects can be used to write or append data into a file. 

In this video, we cover all the basic concepts required to get started with handing files in Python. We first look at how to read a file which is stored in our operating system. And then cover the concepts of how to write data into a file and also how to append data into a file. 
We check out the different between using write and append in Python.

To open the file, we use context manager as well as the traditional method to open a file. We talk about the advantages of using context manager while opening a file in python and also explain why it is recommended in python to always use context manager when dealing with files.

13:17 How to access files in different path in Python


In this video, we also talk about to how to read a file which is present in different paths or directories. By providing absolute path or relative path to the file we can tell python to look for the desired file in that specific location. However, we can also change the current working directory to point at the path where our desired file is placed.
If path is not mentioned, then Python always looks for the file in the current working directory. However, we can change the current working directory so as to point it to the location where our desired file is placed.
Alternatively, we can also provide the directory path of the file which we are trying to read. We can specify a path in two ways, one is by specifying the absolute path and second is by specifying the relative path.
In this video, we talk about relative and absolute path and also show how you can extract the current working directory and also how you can change the current working directory.

Hope you learnt something from this video. If yes, then please make sure to like and share the video with friends and colleagues who may be interested in learning about files in python.

This video is a complete tutorial on Regular Expressions in Python. This is a full course on how to use Regular Expressions in python. Regular Expression is also referred to as REGEX. Using Regular Expression, we can search for a pattern of string in the given text.

Regular Expressions are a very powerful tool used to perform complex searches on a text. By specifying a pattern for the string, we need to search for, Regular Expressions can extract a string even if it is present in different format until and unless this string follows the same pattern as mentioned in the defined Regular Expressions pattern.

In this video, we go through the different steps to be followed to use Regular Expressions in python. We also explain the different character class, special characters and also all the Regular Expressions symbols or notations which can be used to define or create a pattern in Regular Expressions in python. We also write multiple python programs to create different patterns to match an email id, phone no and date values. Finally, we also cover the sub method in Regular Expression which can replace or substitute the matched string with a replacement string.
 
There are only 4 steps to be followed in order to use Regular Expressions in python:
    1. Import re module which is the Regular Expressions module in python. All the functions and features required to perform regular expression search in python can be accessed by importing the re module.
    2. Next steps is to create the Regular Expressions Pattern. Pattern is basically the format or structure of the string that we are trying to search. In Regular Expressions, we have several different character classes, symbols and special characters which will help us to identify every kind of characters or symbols hence making it possible to define a pattern to search of any type of string.
    3. Once the pattern is defined, next step is to search for this pattern in the given text or data.
    4. Finally, we extract all the matched string.

We talk about dictionary data type in python and how to use Python Dictionaries for absolute beginners.

This video is aimed at absolute beginners. We cover how to create dictionaries in python and how to access values from a python dictionary. We cover how to update a dictionary in python and also how to delete an item in python dictionary. 

We go through several important python dictionary methods so as to access the python dictionary keys, values and items. We see how to use them in for loop. 
We also go through methods like get() and setdefault() so as to get an idea of the different possibilities available in python to manage data present in dictionaries. 

Finally, we also look at a way to display the dictionary values more beautifully by using the pprint module.

Lists is a data type in Python. But unlike other data types such as string, integer, float etc. Lists can hold multiple values. The specialty of Lists in Python is that it can hold values of any data type. List can also contain multiple lists within it. In python we can identify a value as list of it is enclosed within the square bracket. 

To define a variable as a list, enter the values within a square bracket. Each value within the list must be separated by a comma. Lists are mutable in nature meaning that values in list can be modified. Individual values within a list can be accessed by using the index. 

Index is the position of each value within the list. In Python Index always starts with zero. Multiple values within the list can be accessed using slices. Slices is nothing but passing two index values separated by a colon.

There are several methods inbuilt to a list in python. Append is a method used to add a value to the end of the list. Whereas remove is the method used to remove a value or item from the list. Similarly, there are several other methods that can be used with a list to perform specific task. This is explained in detail in this video.

The video also explains about how to use lists in for loop and how to use the enumerate function within for loop. We also cover list concatenation and list replication in this video. 

Sorting of lists and finding the length of a list are other topics covered in this video.
This video is aimed at complete beginners so anyone getting started with python should find the video useful. This video is part of the Python Tutorial series for complete beginners. This is the 9th video in this series.

Handling exceptions is one of the most important aspects of a good python program hence in python we can handle exceptions by placing the block of code which we assume to be causing error inside a try and except block. 
Any error caused by the block of code within the try except clause won’t be returned to the user but will be handled by the except block. 

In Python, we can also raise user defined exceptions using the raise Exception clause. Raise exception can be used anywhere in the code to cause an error based on certain conditions. 
We can raise and exception within the try except block so the user defined error can be caught by the try except block. 

Within try except exception handling in python, we can also use ELSE and FINALLY clause. Block of code within else will be executed when the code within try does not throw an error. If the block of code within try causes an exception, then the except block will be called and the block of code within except will be executed. 
Block of code within finally, will be executed every time. Meaning whether there is an exception or not, if you have mentioned finally in your try exception block then the block of code within finally will always be executed.

This video is aimed at complete beginners who are just getting started with programming or with python programming. The concepts are explaining in the most basic manner so anyone can understand it. 

The purpose of this Python tutorial series for beginners is to explain python programming in the most simplest manner by providing simple examples and working out interesting and meaningful python programs which should be a better way to learn programming especially for the beginners.

We also check out the five things you need to remember when working with local and global variables in python.

This is the seventh video in the series of python tutorial for beginners. This video is focused on understanding the different scope in a python program. We see how to identify a local scope and a global scope and then see how to create a local and global variable in python.

Python supports both local and global variables but there are certain rules to follow when working with local and global variables. Important things to note are:
1. Local variables cannot be accessed in global scope.
2. Local variables cannot be accessed from other local scope.
3. Global variables can be accessed by any local scope.
4. Local and Global variables can share the same name.
5. Global variables can be modified inside a local scope using the “global” keyword.

I explain what is a FUNCTION in Python, how to create a function and how to call a function in a python program. This is the sixth video in the series of Python Tutorial for Beginners. How to write a function in python program and different functionalities associated with python functions are covered in this video.

We start by explaining the definition of function and show a sample python code to create a function. How to create a function with a parameter and without a parameter is shown with sample python program. We look at what a parameter is and how to pass an argument during function call. We discuss the difference between an argument and a parameter in python functions.

We also cover return statements in python function. We see what happens when we write a function without a return statement. We also cover how to pass a return value in function. 

Finally, we go through each of these concepts in python functions by writing a sample python program to count the number of vowel characters in a given name. In this sample program we create a function named count vowels using the DEF keyword and then pass a parameter to it. From the python program we call this count vowels function and pass an argument which will be used by our function to find the number of vowel characters in it.

This video is aimed at beginners who would like to understand what a function is in python and how to create a function in python and how to use a parameter and use a return statement in python functions.

We also discuss how to import modules from different directory. 
We see how to write import statement in python using the inbuilt modules in python and then see how to write our own modules and then import this module in our python program. This video also tells you how you can import modules which are present in different directory which is other than the directory of your python program.

This video will give you complete details of IMPORT statement in python and the advantages of using them in our python program. The concepts are explained in detail for complete beginners. This is the fifth video in the series of Python Tutorial for beginners. 

I explain the concepts by writing python program to import different types of modules in python. We see some example of how to import and use some of the in-built modules in python. Later I also write my own python modules and then import it in my python program. Finally, I place my own module in a new directory and then show you steps in detail how you can add this new directory permanently into sys.path variable so python can import modules from this directory.

IF ELSE Statement in Python are part of the Flow Control Statements. This is the third video in the series of Python Tutorial for Beginners. But before writing IF statement, we learn what is a Boolean data type, what are comparison operators and what are boolean operators or Logical operators. These concepts are required to be understood before starting with IF ELSE statement.


IF statement is part of the Flow Control statements in python which also includes loop statements such as while loop and for loop. 
Flow control statement or control flow statement in python decides which instruction to execute based on which condition hence it’s a very essential part of python programming.

The condition in IF statement either needs to have an expression which always evaluate to a boolean value or the condition in IF statement needs to have a boolean value. 
Understanding of Python Boolean is essential to understand IF statement. We also cover boolean operator which is also referred to as logical operator. Finally we also look into comparison operator which is required to form an expression which can be used in IF statement.

IF statement in python also includes ELIF (which stands for ELSE IF) and ELSE section which is explained in the video by writing sample program which uses these IF, ELSE and ELIF statements to perform certain actions.

All these concepts are not just explained theoretically but also by working out some examples using the IDLE IDE which comes along with your Python installation and also using Visual Studio code IDE to write and execute python program.

The purpose of this Python tutorial series for beginners is to explain python programming in the most simplest manner by providing simple examples and working out interesting and meaningful python programs which should be a better way to learn programming especially for the beginners.

In this video, we cover python variables, how to create a variable and how to create variable of different data type. We also learn how to use a variable in python program and what is the purpose of having a variable in python.

Python Variables are the most basic python programming concept and having a clear understanding of how and when to create a variable is very important.

Python variables are not declared and same python variable can hold values of any data type. These concepts will be covered in the video.
We will also write sample python program which uses a variable to perform certain actions.

This video also covers the rules for creating variables in python and how python variable is different from other programming languages. We also look at few samples for valid and invalid variable names in python.
 
All these concepts are not just explained theoretically but also by working out some examples using the IDLE IDE which comes along with your Python installation and also using Visual Studio code IDE to write and execute python program.

We start by installing Python 3 and then go through 3 ways to write and execute Python program on Mac.
3 ways to write and execute Python program covered in this video are:
    1. Using IDLE, which is an IDE that comes along with Python installation.
    2. Using any text editor (in my case I use Atom) to write python program and then execute the program using Terminal window.
    3. By using Visual Studio Code (or simple VS Code), which is considered as one of the best IDE for Python.

Installing Python 3 on Mac can be confusing due to the existence of Python 2 which is preinstalled on all Mac OS. However, Python 2 and Python 3 can co-exist on the same machine hence we do not need to uninstall Python 2 before installing Python 3.

To Install Python 3, there are no prerequisites, and the installation is pretty straight forward.
To run your Python code may be confusing for beginners hence in this video we cover 3 different ways or 3 different editors which can be used to get started with writing and running python code.

When executing python code through IDLE, it’s essential to execute the RUN command from the text editor and then view the output in IDLE interpreter.
Whereas text editor does not have the functionality to run program by itself hence we use Terminal window to run the program.
Visual Studio Code (or simple VS Code) along with PyCharm, Jupiter Notebook and few others are considered as one of the best IDE for Python hence in this video we show how VS Code can be used to write and Run Python program.

The video is aimed at helping beginners to get started with installation of Python programming language on Mac and by showing multiple ways to start writing and executing Python code.

Now why exactly do we need to put them in containers? Because we have already extracted the data. Can;t we just put them in some kind of database? The answer is yes. You can. But there might be a few problems when you are storing the data directly in the database when you are working on big/multiple projects.

Scrapy spiders can return the extracted data as Python dictionaries which we have already been doing right with our quotes project. But the problem with Python dictionaries is that it lacks structure. It is easy to make a typo in a field name or return inconsistent data, especially in a larger project with many spiders.

So it's always a good idea to move the scraped data to temporary location called containers and then store them inside the database. So these temporary containers are called as items.

So if we discuss the flow of our scraped data it somewhat looks like this. It first gets scraped by our spider then it is stored inside the temporary containers called items and then you can store them inside a JSON file. But if we want send this data to a database we have to add one more step to this flow. After storing them inside item containers we are going to send them to this pipeline where this process_item method is automatically called and the item variable will contain are scraped data.

Now before watching this video make sure that you have watched previous two videos in which we cover how to store data inside an sqlite database because a lot of the concepts that I teach in those videos are going to be used in this video. And I don't want to go over them again.

Now the first thing we need to do is install MySQL on our computer. You can go to this link if you are on windows to install MySQL. But if you are using Linux you can check this link out to install and use MySQL. I am going to covering only the windows part of installation because the Linux installation is pretty easy.

Now just click on this link to start the installation. I am going through this installation pretty quickly because it's simple. While installing make sure that you choose the developer's default option because we want everything installed on our computer including Connectors, routers, servers and MySQL Work Bench which is a GUI software to connect and handle various connections.

Also when you are asked to choose the root password. You can choose whatever you want but make sure that you remember the root password because we are going to be using the same password everywhere. If you forget this password it's going to be difficult to reset it.

Steps -

1) Install MySQL https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/
Linux - https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/installing-mysql-server-on-ubuntu/

- Make sure you go with default options.
- Remember the root password

2) Install MySQL-connector-python
2) Create a new connection using Mysql workbench
3) Create a new database myquotes using SQL workbench
4) Write the code in Pipelines
5) Scrape the data
6) Show the data in SQL Workbench

Now why are we exactly learning to login? A lot of websites will restrict the content that you might want to scrape behind a login page. So to scrape that restricted data. It's always a good idea to learn how to login into websites using scrapy.

Now just to internalize the concepts we have learned, we will be a working on a complete really life project of scraping amazon.com

We will be scraping the books department of amazon. More specifically the collection of books that were released in the last 30 days. Now if you are following along, you don't have to choose books. You can choose any department on amazon.

I already created the project 'AmazonTutorial' on pycharm and have installed scrapy. If you don't remember how to install scrapy you can always go back to my installing scrapy video.

Now before we run our spider, I just want you want to tell you that are program might not work. If you have scraped amazon before then it's not going to work but if this you first time then the above code will work. The reason for it not working is that amazon puts on restrictions when you are trying to scrape a lot of its data. So we are going to bypass those restriction by using something known as user agents. But before we get into that lets actually run our program

So what exactly is this user agent and how is it able to bypass the restrictions placed by amazon?

Whenever a browser like chrome or Mozilla visits a website, that website asks for the identity of your browser. That identity of you browser is known as a user-agent. And if we give the same identity to a website like amazon. It places restrictions and sometimes bans the computer from visiting amazon.

So there are two ways to trick amazon. First is to use user-agents that are allowed by amazon. For example, amazon has to allow Google to crawl it's website if it wants it's products to be shown on Google Search. So we can basically replace our user-agent with Google's user-agent which is known as Google bot and trick amazon into thinking that actually Google is crawling the website and not us. And this exactly what we did in the last video. We found out the Google's user-agent name by typing it in Google Search. And then we replaced our user agent with Google.

The other way is to keep rotating our user-agents. If amazon identifies our computer using our user-agent then we can probably use fake user-agents in rotation and trick amazon into thinking that a lot of browsers are visiting the website instead of just one and this is what we will be learning in this video.

Before we go into proxies, you need to understand what is an IP address. An IP address is basically an address of your computer. You can find your own IP address by going to google and typing in 'What is my IP'.

Whenever you connect to a website you are automatically telling them your IP address. A website like amazon can recognize your IP address and ban you if you try to scrape a lot of it's data. But what if used a another IP address instead of our own. And even better we can use a lot of IP addresses that our not our own, and put them in rotation. So we every-time we send a request to amazon. It's going to be with a different IP address. 

When you use an IP address that is not your own. Then that other IP address is known as a proxy. If we look up the definition of proxy on google it says 'the authority to represent someone else'. So basically we are hiding our address and using someone elses.

We'll then progress onto more advanced and sophisticated topics that integrate artificial neural networks and deep learning into reinforcement learning. We'll also be getting our hands dirty by implementing some super cool reinforcement learning projects in code! Without further ado, let's get to it!

In this video, we'll discuss Markov decision processes, or MDPs. Markov decision processes give us a way to formalize sequential decision making. This formalization is the basis for structuring problems that are solved with reinforcement learning. 

We will detail the components that make up an MDP, including: the environment, the agent, the states of the environment, the actions the agent can take in the environment, and the rewards that may be given to the agent for its actions.

We'll see that the return is exactly what's driving the agent to make the decisions it makes. We'll also introduce the idea of episodes and talk about episodic tasks vs. continuing tasks.

This will lead us to exploring optimal value functions, and specifically, optimal Q-functions, which we'll learn must satisfy a fundamental property called the Bellman optimality equation.

In this video, we'll be introducing the idea of Q-learning with value iteration, which is a reinforcement learning technique used for learning the optimal policy in a Markov Decision Process. 

We'll illustrate how this technique works by introducing a game where a reinforcement learning agent tries to maximize points, and through this, we'll also learn about Q-tables and the trade-off between exploration and exploitation.

Last time, we left our discussion of Q-learning with the question of how an agent chooses to either explore the environment or to exploit it in order to select its actions. In this video, we'll answer this question by introducing a type of strategy called an epsilon greedy strategy.

We'll also explore how, using this strategy, the agent makes decisions about the actions it takes. We'll also see how exactly Q-value is calculated and updated in the Q-table mathematically using an example from the lizard game we introduced last time.

In this video, we'll continue our discussion of deep Q-networks. Before we can move on to discussing exactly how a DQN is trained, we're first going to explain the concepts of experience replay and replay memory, which are utilized during the training process. So, let's get to it!

Machine learning : 
Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

What is machine learning used for?

Machine learning is used in internet search engines, email filters to sort out spam, websites to make personalized recommendations, banking software to detect unusual transactions, and lots of apps on our phones such as voice recognition.

What are the four types of machine learning?
There are four types of machine learning algorithms: supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement.

What is meant by logistic regression?
Logistic regression is a statistical analysis method used to predict a data value based on prior observations of a data set. A logistic regression model predicts a dependent data variable by analyzing the relationship between one or more existing independent variables.

What is the main purpose of logistic regression?
Logistic regression is used to obtain odds ratio in the presence of more than one explanatory variable. The procedure is quite similar to multiple linear regression, with the exception that the response variable is binomial. The result is the impact of each variable on the odds ratio of the observed event of interest.

Why logistic regression is the best?
Logistic regression is a simple and more efficient method for binary and linear classification problems. It is a classification model, which is very easy to realize and achieves very good performance with linearly separable classes. It is an extensively employed algorithm for classification in industry.

SVM is a popular machine learning algorithm and mostly used for classification problems but we can use it for regression problems also.

The objective of the support vector machine algorithm is to find a hyperplane (Line)which is separating the classes of your dataset in a good way . For that we calculate a Margin. A margin is a gap between the line with the closest class points of the dataset. I have explained the whole concept in a video. Please go through it.

NOTE: Check description for updated Notebook links.

Data Analysis has been around for a long time, but up until a few years ago, it was practiced using closed, expensive and limited tools like Excel or Tableau. Python, SQL and other open libraries have changed Data Analysis forever.

In this tutorial you'll learn the whole process of Data Analysis: reading data from multiple sources (CSVs, SQL, Excel, etc), processing them using NumPy and Pandas, visualize them using Matplotlib and Seaborn and clean and process it to create reports.
Additionally, we've included a thorough Jupyter Notebook tutorial, and a quick Python reference to refresh your programming skills.

You now have some great graphical EDA tools. You can quickly generate and investigate a histogram. You can immediately get a feel for your data by plotting all of them, with bee swarm plots or ECDFs.

In almost every data set we encounter in this course, and in its sequel, and also in real life, we start with graphical EDA. Remember what Tukey said, ""Exploratory data analysis can never be the whole story, but nothing else can serve as the foundation stone."" In the next chapter, you will build upon graphical EDA with quantitative EDA, which allows you to compute useful summary statistics.

With your foundation stone in place, you will spend the last half of this course learning to think probabilistically. You will learn about probability distributions for both discrete and continuous variables, which provide the mathematical foundation for you to draw meaningful conclusions from your data. We will not get mired in mathematical details, but rather will unleash the power of the NumPy random module to use hacker statistics in order to simulate the probabilistic stories and distributions that we encounter.

You will find that by writing a few lines of Python code, you can perform even putatively complicated statistical analyses. As you work through this course and its sequel, you will grow ever closer to being able to tell what Tukey calls ""the whole story."" Now, let's get to work!","['data science', 'data', 'data analysis', 'learn python', 'python tutorial', 'python for data science', 'python for data analysis', 'data science tutorials', 'data analysis tutorials', 'exploratory data analysis', 'statistics']",2016-11-09T22:12:13Z,36100,71,,4,PT1M27S,sd,False,135000,21427061,1289

We saw in the last video the clarity of bee swarm plots. However, there is a limit to their efficacy. For example, imagine we wanted to plot the county-level voting data for all states east of the Mississippi River and all states west. We make the swarm plot as before, but using a DataFrame that contains all states, with each classified as being east or west of the Mississippi.

The bee swarm plot has a real problem. The edges have overlapping data points, which was necessary in order to fit all points onto the plot. We are now obfuscating data. So, using a bee swarm plot here is not the best option.

As an alternative, we can compute an empirical cumulative distribution function, or ECDF. Again, this is best explained by example. Here is a picture of an ECDF of the percentage of swing state votes that went to Obama. A x-value of an ECDF is the quantity you are measuring, in this case the percent of vote that sent to Obama. The y-value is the fraction of data points that have a value smaller than the corresponding x-value. For example, 20% of counties in swing states had 36% or less of its people vote for Obama. Similarly, 75% of counties in swing states had 50% or less of its people vote for Obama.

Let's look at how to make one of these from our data. The x-axis is the sorted data. We need to generate it using the NumPy function sort, so we need to import Numpy, which we do using the alias np as is commonly done. The we can use np.sort() to generate our x-data. The y-axis is evenly spaced data points with a maximum of one, which we can generate using the np.arange() function and then dividing by the total number of data points. Once we specify the x and y values, we plot the points.

By default, plt.plot() plots lines connecting the data points. To plot our ECDF, we just want points. To achieve this we pass the string '.' and the string 'none' to the keywords arguments marker and linestyle, respectively.

As you remember from my forceful reminder in an earlier video, we label the axes. Finally, we use the plt.margins() function to make sure none of the data points run over the side of the plot area. Choosing a value of 0.02 gives a 2% buffer all around the plot.

The result is the beautiful ECDF I just showed you. We can also easily plot multiple ECDFs on the same plot. For example, here are the ECDFs for the three swing states. We see that Ohio and Pennsylvania were similar, with Pennsylvania having slightly more Democratic counties. Florida, on the other hand, had a greater fraction of heavily Republican counties.

In my workflow, I almost always plot the ECDF first. It shows all the data and gives a complete picture of how the data are distributed. But don't take my word for how great ECDFs are. You can see for yourself in the exercises!","['data science', 'data', 'data analysis', 'learn python', 'python tutorial', 'python for data science', 'python for data analysis', 'data science tutorials', 'data analysis tutorials', 'statistics', 'plots']",2016-11-09T22:09:43Z,79673,321,,25,PT3M25S,sd,False,135000,21427061,1289

The histogram of county-level election data was informative. We learned that more counties voted for McCain than for Obama. Since our goal is to learn from data, this is great! However, a major drawback of using histograms is that the same data set can look different depending on how the bins are chosen. And choice of bins is in many ways arbitrary. This leads to binning bias; you might interpret your plot differently for two different choices of bin number.

An additional problem with histograms is that we are not plotting all of the data. We are sweeping the data into bins, and losing their actual values.

To remedy these problems we can make a bee swarm plot, also called a swarm plot. This is best shown by example.

Here is a beeswarm plot of the vote totals in the three swing states. Each point in the plot represents the share of the vote Obama got in a single county. The position along the y-axis is the quantitative information. The data are spread in x to make them visible, but their precise location along the x-axis is unimportant. Notably, we no longer have any binning bias and all data are displayed.

This plot may be conveniently generated using Seaborn. A requirement is that your data are in a well-organized Pandas DataFrame where each column is a feature and each row an observation. In this case, an observation is a county, and the features are state and the Democratic share of the vote.

To make the plot, you need to specify which column gives the values for the y-axis, in this case the share of the vote that went to the Democrat Barack Obama, and the values for the x-axis, in this case the state. And of course, you need to tell it which DataFrame contains the data.

From this plot, too, we can clearly see that Obama got less than 50% of the vote in the majority of counties in each of the three swing states. This time it is more detailed than a histogram, but without too much added visual complexity.

Now it's your turn to make some bee swarm plots!","['data science', 'data', 'data analysis', 'learn python', 'python tutorial', 'python for data science', 'python for data analysis', 'data science tutorials', 'data analysis tutorials', 'statistics', 'plots']",2016-11-09T22:06:38Z,32797,52,,1,PT2M22S,sd,False,135000,21427061,1289

We saw in the last video that a histogram can be a useful plot to generate when exploring a data set. Let's go over how we can create one.

We are interested in the fraction of the vote that went to Barack Obama in each county. We can plot this as a histogram using the matplotlib.pyplot module's hist() function. We pass it the dem_share column of the DataFrame. We could have also passed a NumPy array with the same data, and it works just fine. In fact, for this course and its sequel, you can use DataFrames and NumPy arrays interchangeably.

Note that plt.hist() returns three arrays that I am not interested in; I only want the plot. I therefore assign a dummy variable called ""underscore"" to them, which is common practice in Python.

After creating the histogram, we label the axes. Always label your axes, for histograms or any other kind of plot. Otherwise no one can know what it is you are plotting.

You probably didn't notice, but this plot looks slightly different than the first plot I showed. You can see it if you look at them side-by-side. They are different because they have different binning. In the plot at left, we have ten bins that were automatically generated by the default settings of plt.hist(), and I set up the bins on the right myself. I specified where the edges of the bars of the histogram are, the bin edges, and use the bins keyword argument to pass that to plt.hist().

You can also specify a number of bins, say 20, using the bins keyword argument, and Matplotlib will automatically generate 20 evenly spaced bins.

Now, the plots we've made so far are stylized with Matplotlib's default settings. I prefer to use the default settings of Seaborn, an excellent matplotlib-based statistical data visualization package written primarily by Michael Waskom. We import it as sns, as is traditionally done. Upon import, we can set the style to be Seaborn's default, using the sns.set() function. This results in nicely formatted plots. Beyond this stylistic functionality, Seaborn offers useful plotting functions that we will explore in the next video.

Before we do that, let's practice making histograms with some exercises.","['data science', 'data', 'data analysis', 'learn python', 'python tutorial', 'python for data science', 'python for data analysis', 'data science tutorials', 'data analysis tutorials', 'histograms', 'statistics']",2016-11-09T22:03:39Z,135182,422,,9,PT2M28S,sd,False,135000,21427061,1289

Yogi Berra said, ""You can observe a lot by watching."" The same is true with data. If you can appropriately display your data, you can already start to draw conclusions from it.

I'll go even further: exploring your data is a crucial step in your analysis. When I say exploring your data, I mean organizing and plotting your data, and maybe computing a few numerical summaries about them.

This idea is known as exploratory data analysis, or EDA, and was developed by one of the greatest statistitians of all time, John Tukey. He wrote a book entitled Exploratory Data Analysis in 1977 where he laid out the principles. In that book, he said, ""Exploratory data analysis can never be the whole story, but nothing else can serve as the foundation stone."" I wholeheartedly agree with this, so we will begin our study of statistical thinking with EDA.

Let's consider an example.

Here, we have a data set I acquired from data.gov containing the election results of 2008 at the county level in each of the three major swing states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Florida. Those are the ones that largely decide recent elections in the US. This is how they look when I open the file with my text editor. They are a little prettier if we look at them with in a Pandas DataFrame, in this case only looking at the columns of immediate interest, the state, county, and share of the vote that went to Democrat Barack Obama.

We could stare the these numbers, but I think you'll agree that it is pretty hopeless to gain any sort of understanding from doing this. Alternatively, we could charge in headlong and start defining and computing parameters and their confidence intervals, and do hypothesis tests. You will learn how to do all of these things in this course and its sequel. But a good field commander does not just charge into battle without first getting a feel for the terrain and sizing up the opposing army. So, like the field commander, we should explore the data first.

In this chapter, we will discuss graphical exploratory data analysis. This involves taking data from tabular form, like we have here in the DataFrame, and representing it graphically. You are presenting the same information, but it is in a more human-interpretable form.

For example, we take the Democratic share of the vote in the counties of all of the three swing states and plot them as a histogram. The height of each bar is the number of counties that had the given level of support for Obama. For example, the tallest bar is the number of counties that had between 40% and 50% of its votes cast for Obama.

Right away, because there is more area in the histogram to the left of 50%, we can see that more counties voted for Obama's opponent, John McCain, than voted for Obama.

Look at that. Just by making one plot, we could already draw a conclusion about the data, which would have been extraordinarily tedious by hand counting in the DataFrame.

Now let's review some of the basic ideas behind EDA with a couple exercises.","['data science', 'data', 'data analysis', 'learn python', 'python tutorial', 'python for data science', 'python for data analysis', 'data science tutorials', 'data analysis tutorials', 'exploratory data analysis', 'EDA', 'statistics']",2016-11-09T21:56:15Z,23112,65,,5,PT3M19S,sd,False,135000,21427061,1289

This is the 1st course on Statistical Thinking in Python. You will learn powerful concepts and tools to help you get the most out of your data.

My name is Justin Bois and I am a lecturer in the Division of Biology and Biological Engineering at the California Institute of Technology. I am dedicated to empowering students and researchers in the biological sciences with quantitative tools, particularly data analysis skills.

The end goal of the analysis of a data set is to be able to draw conclusions, to make judgments, based on the data. This is the realm of statistical inference. Thus, any data scientist must have a strong statistical grounding to get the most out of their data. They also must have a computational framework to do the statistics; ours is Python-based. In this course, and its sequel, you will learn the relevant conceptual and computational tools to have that grounding. You will learn the basics of exploratory data analysis, also called EDA: you will learn to plot your data in instructive ways using Python and how to interpret such plots. You will also learn how to use a variety of summary statistics to make sense of and communicate meaningful information about your data.

We will wrap up by working with probability distributions, how they arise from stories that occur in the real world, and you will come out being able to simulate stories and their distributions using hacker statistics. In the sequel to the course, you will apply all of these new techniques to parameter estimation, linear regression, and hypothesis testing. The sequel culminates with you using your newly learned Python-based tools to do your own analysis on a real data set of scientific pertinence: you will analyze actual measurements of the beaks of Darwin's finches from the Galápagos.

Introduction to SQL

The SQL query language can be used to do anything within the database. It can select data, insert new data, update existing data, and delete it. It can also be used to create, alter and delete tables and columns. The first SQL statement we'll learn is the select statement, which provides the basic method of extracting information from your database.

The general syntax of a select statement is select COLUMNS from TABLE CONDITIONS. For Example, we can select the pop2008 column from the people table. We can also select all the columns from the people table with a '*'. Let's execute this last query.

We'll begin by importing create_engine and creating an engine. Next, we will establish a connection by using the connect method on the engine. Then we can define our select statement and pass it to the execute method on the connection. This gives us an object we can use to fetch the results, which we assign to the variable results_proxy. Then we tell results_proxy to fetch all the results via the fetchall method. Now results will contain all of our data from the people table. Let's pause for just a moment and look at that object that the execute method gave us.

That object is called a ResultProxy and it can be used in a variety of different ways to get the data returned by our query. When we use a fetch method, such as fetchall, on the ResultProxy, we get a ResultSet that contains the actual data we asked for in the query. This separation between the ResultProxy and the ResultSet allows us to fetch as much or as little data as we desire. We'll explore this more in a later section. Let's learn how to work with a ResultSet.

In this example we are using the results from the prior query. We'll start by getting the first_row of the results using an index of 0. By printing the first row, we can see the data it contains. If we want to know what columns are in the row, we can find out by using the keys method. Finally, we print the value of the state column from the first row, by using the column name as an attribute on the row object.

In the prior query example, we wrote a normal SQL statement as a string; however, manipulating a string to build more complex statements can be very overwhelming.

The beauty of SQLAlchemy is that it allows us to assemble these complex statements in a Pythonic way. Pythonic refers to code that adheres to the idioms of Python's common guidelines and express its intent in a highly readable way. SQLAlchemy also hides the difference between database types so we can focus on the data we want to work with instead of the differences we might encounter in each database type. Let's rebuild the same query using SQLAlchemy.

The first three steps of creating an engine and establishing a connection will be the same. After that, we will need to initialize our metadata and reflect the table as we did previously. Then in line 7, we build our select statement. Hang tight we'll talk more about this in a second. Finally, we execute the statement and fetch all the results.

The SQLAlchemy select statement works the same as a SQL select statement, and in its most basic form takes a list of Column or Table objects. For example, stmt = select([census]) will select all the columns of all the rows in the census table. SQLAlchemy generates the same SQL statement we wrote by hand. We can see that by using the print() function on the statement which outputs SELECT * FROM census.

Now it's your turn write several SQL queries, both as raw SQL and in the more Pythonic way using SQLAlchemy. We'll be continuing to use the US Census database. Let's practice.","['data science', 'data', 'data analysis', 'learn python', 'python tutorial', 'python for data science', 'python for data analysis', 'data science tutorials', 'data analysis tutorials', 'SQL', 'SQL queries in Python']",2016-11-09T21:32:56Z,39622,118,,10,PT3M20S,sd,False,135000,21427061,1289

In the python world, there are several great tools that we can use when working with databases. One of those is SQLAlchemy that we will be using throughout this course. SQLAlchemy will allow us to generate SQL queries by writing Python code. You should still consider learning how to write queries in SQL as well.

SQLAlchemy has two main components. The part we will be focusing on is often referred to as ""core"" part of SQLAlchemy. It's really focused around the relational model of the database. Additionally, there is the Object Relational Model or ORM part of SQLAlchemy that is really focused around data models and classes that you as a programmer create.

There are many different types of databases, and each database type has its own quirks and unique capabilities. You'll commonly find SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle when working with data. SQLAlchemy provides a way to operate across all of these database types in a consistent manner.

To connect to a database, we need a way to talk to it, and an engine provides that common interface. To create an engine, we import the create_engine function from sqlalchemy; we then use the create_engine function and supply it a connection string that provides the details needed to connect to a database. Finally once we have an engine, we are ready to make a connection using the connect method on the engine. It's worth noting that SQLAlchemy won't actually make the connection until we give it some work to execute. So to review, an engine is the common interface to the database, which requires a connection string to provide the details used to find and connect to the database.

Before we go any further, let's talk a bit more about connection strings. In their simplest form, they tell us what kind of database we are talking to and how we should access it. In this example, you can see that we are using the sqlite database driver and the database file named census_nyc.sqlite which is in the current directory.

Now that we have an engine and a connection, we need to know what tables are in the database. We'll start again by importing the create_engine function and creating an engine to our database. Finally, We can use the table_names method of the engine which returns a list of tables.

Once we know what table we want to work on, we need a way to access that table with python. To do that we are going to use a handy process called reflection, which reads the database and builds a Table object that we can use in our code. We already have created our engine, so we begin by importing the MetaData and Table objects needed for reflection. The MetaData object is a catalog that stores database information such as tables so we don't have to keep looking them up. To reflect the table, we initialize a MetaData object. Next, we use the SQLAlchemy Table object and provide the table name we got earlier from the table_names method. We also supply our metadata instance, and then instruct it to autoload the table using the engine. Finally, we can use the function repr to view the details of our table that we stored as census. This allows us to see the names of the columns, such as 'state' and 'sex', along with their types, such as VARCHAR and INTEGER.

This process of reflection may seem a bit of an overhead, but it will make understanding your databases and extracting information from them far easier downstream. Now it's your turn to practice writing connection strings, connecting to databases and reflecting tables. Then we'll be back here writing our first SQL queries.","['data science', 'data', 'data analysis', 'learn python', 'python tutorial', 'python for data science', 'python for data analysis', 'data science tutorials', 'data analysis tutorials', 'database', 'connecting to database']",2016-11-09T21:30:43Z,91778,569,,16,PT3M10S,sd,False,135000,21427061,1289

Welcome to introduction to databases in python.

My name is Jason Myers and I'm a software engineer and my area of expertise is in developing data analytics platforms.

Relational databases are the foundation of many applications and data systems widely used today. They are also extremely common in the world of data science and analytics.

Relational databases are made up of tables which store our data. For example, here are a couple of tables from the Census database that we'll be using in this course. The census table on the left holds location and demographic information along with population counts from the census data. Meanwhile the state_fact table on the right holds additional details about the states themselves such as the abbreviation and type of the location.

Tables themselves consist of columns and rows. The columns of a database define the name of an element or field in our data, such as the age column highlighted here. They also specify the data type, such as string of integer, which we'll talk more about in a later section. All of the data in a table is stored within the rows of a table. The row highlighted here contains the population counts in 2000 and 2008 for new born females in New York state.

Tables can also be ""related"" to one another by a column acting as a key or bridge that tells it which piece of data it is associated with in another table. This feature is where relational databases get the relational part of their name. Here, we've highlighted the state column in the census table and the name column in the state_fact table. We can use this relationship to get additional information about the relevant state, such as its abbreviation, for any row in the census table. The structure of tables in relational databases, along with how they can be related as outlined here, is known as the relational model.

We'll soon learn how to extract information from such a database, but first, let's test your knowledge of the relational model with a multiple choice question.",,2016-11-09T21:28:20Z,26528,76,,2,PT1M53S,sd,False,135000,21427061,1289

Wow! you have just scraped HTML data from the web and you've done so using two different packages: urllib and requests. You also saw that requests provided a higher-level interface in that you needed to write less lines of to retrieve the relevant HTML as a string. You've got the HTML of your page of interest but, generally HTML is a humble-jumble mix of both unstructured and structured data.

A word on these terms:

structured data is data that has a pre-defined data model or that is organized in a defined manner.
unstructured data is data that does not possess either of these properties.
HTML is interesting because, although much of it is unstructured text, it does contain tags that determine where, for examples, headings can be found, and hyperlinks. In general, to turn HTML that you have scraped from the world wide web into useful data, you'll need to parse it and extract structured data from it. In this video and the next few interactive exercises, we'll provide a brief introduction to how you can perform such tasks using the Python package Beautiful Soup. Lets check out the package's website:

The first words at the top are:

You didn't write that awful page. You're just trying to get some data out of it. Beautiful Soup is here to help. Since 2004, it's been saving programmers hours or days of work on quick-turnaround screen scraping projects.
Firstly, a word on the name of the package: Beautiful Soup? In web development, the term ""tag soup"" refers to structurally or syntactically incorrect HTML code written for a web page. What Beautiful Soup does best is to make tag soup beautiful again and to extract information from it with ease! In fact, the main object created and queried when using this package is called BeautifulSoup and it has a very important associated method called prettify!

Lets now see Beautiful Soup in Beautiful Action!

Once again, you use requests to scrape the HTML from the web.
Then you create a BeautifulSoup object from the resulting HTML and prettify.
Printing the prettified Soup and the original HTML, you can see that for, example, the prettified Soup is indented in the way you would expect properly written HTML to be.
You'll explore a few of the methods that you can apply to your soupified HTML in the following exercises, such as title and get_text, which extract the title and text, respectively.

You'll also work with the Soupy method find_all in order to extract the URLs of all of the hyperlinks in the HTML.

These are merely a few of many methods existing in BeautifulSoup to extract data from HTML. If, after completing these exercises, you find yourself thirsting for more BeautifulSoup, there are plenty of great resources on their website.

OK: now it's your turn to jump into the deep end of the proverbial soup bowl!

Congrats on importing your first web data! In order to import files from the web, we used the urlretrieve function from urllib.requests. Lets now unpack this a bit and, in the process, understand a few things about how the internet works:

URL stands for Uniform or Universal Resource Locator and all they really are are references to web resources. The vast majority of URLs are web addresses, but they can refer to a few other things, such as file transfer protocols (FTP) and database access. We'll currently focus on those URLs that are web addresses OR the locations of websites.

Such a URL consists of 2 parts:

A protocol identifier http ot https and
A resource name such as datacamp.com
The combination of protocol identifier and resource name uniquely specifies the web address!

To explain URLs, I have introduced yet another acronym http, which itself stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. Wikipedia provides a great description of HTTP:

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.
Note that HTTPS is a more secure form of HTTP. Each time you go to a website, you are actually sending an HTTP request to a server. This request is known as a GET request, by far the most common type of HTTP request.

We are actually performing a GET request when using the function urlretrieve. The ingenuity of urlretrieve also lies in fact that it not only makes a GET request but also saves the relevant data locally.

In the following, you'll learn how to make more GET requests to store web data in your environment. In particular, you'll figure out how to get the HTML data from a webpage. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is the standard markup language for the web.

To extract the html from the wikipedia home page, you

Import the necessary functions;
Specify the URL;
Package the GET request using the function Request;
Send the request and catch the response using the function urlopen;
This returns an HTTPResponse object, which has an associated read method;
You then apply this read method to the response, which returns the HTML as a string, which you store in the variable html.
You remember to be polite and close the response!
Now we are going to do the same, however here we'll use the requests package, which provides a wonderful API for making requests. According to the requests package website:

Requests allows you to send organic, grass-fed HTTP/1.1 requests, without the need for manual labor.
and the following organizations claim to use requests internally:

Her Majesty's Government, Amazon, Google, Twilio, NPR, Obama for America, Twitter, Sony, and Federal U.S. Institutions that prefer to be unnamed
Moreover,

Requests is one of the most downloaded Python packages of all time, pulling in over 7,000,000 downloads every month. All the cool kids are doing it!
Lets now see requests at work:

Here you

Import the package requests;
Specify the URL;
Package the request, send the request and catch the response with a single function requests.get();
Apply the text method to the response which returns the HTML as a string;
That's enough out of me for the time being: let's get you hacking away at pulling down some HTML from the web using GET requests!

You're now able to import data in Python from all sorts of file types: flat files such as .txts and .csvs, othe file types such as pickled files, Excel spreadsheets and MATLAB files. You've also gained valuable experience in querying relational databases to import data from them using SQL. You have really come a long way: congratulations!

However, all of these skills involve importing data from files that you have locally. Much of the time as a data scientist, these skills won't be quite enough because you won't always have the data that you need. You will need to import it from the web. Say, for example, you want to import the Wine Quality dataset from the Machine Learning Repository hosted by the University of California, Irvine. How do you get this file from the web? Now you could use your favourite web browser of choice to navigate to the relevant URL, point and click on the appropriate hyperlinks to download the file but this poses a few problems:

Firstly, it isn't written in code and so poses reproducibility problems. If another Data Scientist wanted to reproduce your workflow it, she would necessarily have to do so ouside Python;
Secondly, it is NOT scalable: if you wanted to download one hundred or one thousand such files, it would take one hundred or one thousand times as long, respectively, whereas if you wrote it in code, your workflow could scale.
As reproducibility and scalability are situated at the very heart of Data Science, you're going to learn in this Chapter how to use Python code to import and locally save datasets from the world wide web.

You'll also learn how to load such datasets into pandas dataframes directly from the web, whether they be flat files or otherwise. Then you'll place these skills in the wider context of making HTTP requests: in particular, you'll make HTTP GET requests, which in plain English means getting data from the web. You'll use these new Request skills to learn the basics of scraping HTML from the internet and you'll use the wonderful Python package BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and turn it into data.

There are a number of great packages to help us import web data: herein, you'll become familiar with the urllib and requests packages. We'll first check out urllib:

This module provides a high-level interface for fetching data across the World Wide Web. In particular, the urlopen() function is similar to the built-in function open(), but accepts Universal Resource Locators (URLs) instead of filenames.
Let's now dive directly in to importing data from the web with an example, importing the Wine quality dataset for White wine. Don't get jealous: in the first interactive exercise, it will be your job to import the Red wine dataset!

All we have done here is

imported a function called urlretrieve from the request subpackage of the urllib package;
we assigned the relevant URL as a string to the variable url;
we then used the urlretrieve function to write the contents of the url to a file 'winequality-white.csv'.
Now it's your turn to do the same but for red wine! In the following interactive exercises you'll also figure out how to use pandas to load the contents of web files directly into pandas dataframes without first having to save them locally.

We have seen a number of ways to read, print and import flat files. As a data scientist, you will most often wish to use pandas, however it was important to check out all the possible ways to import because you never know when they will be useful. In the next Chapter, we'll see just how useful pandas can be when attempting to import a variety of other file types, such as native SAS & Stata files. It is also important to remember that, due to the active development community in open source softwares, there is constant activity in file formats and ways to import data: for example, on March 29, 2016, Wes McKinney, the creator of pandas, and Hadley Wickham, of R development fame, announced a new and fast on-disk format for dataframes for R and Python, called feather . As dataframes are one the most important data structures for data scientists, let's definitely keep our eyes on feather.

After learning to import many other file types in the next Chapter, you'll learn how to interact with relational databases in Python, how to tear all types of data down from the web and how to interact with APIs to fulfil your big data fix.

Congrats! You're now able to import a bunch of different types of flat files into Python as NumPy arrays. Although arrays are incredibly powerful and serve a number of essential purposes, they cannot fulfil one of the most basic needs of a Data Scientist: to have ‘[two]-dimensional labeled data structure[s] with columns of potentially different types’ that you can easily perform a plethora of Data Sciencey type things on: manipulate, slice, reshaped, groupby, join, merge, perform statistics in a missing-value-friendly manner, deal with times series. The need for such a data structure, among other issues, prompted Wes McKinney to develop the pandas library for Python. Nothing speaks to the project of pandas more than the documentation itself: ‘Python has long been great for data munging and preparation, but less so for data analysis and modeling. pandas helps fill this gap, enabling you to carry out your entire data analysis workflow in Python without having to switch to a more domain specific language like R.’ The data structure most relevant to the data manipulation and analysis workflow that pandas offers is the dataframe and it is the Pythonic analogue of R’s dataframe. As Hadley Wickham tweeted, ""A matrix has rows and columns. A data frame has observations and variables.""

Manipulating dataframes in pandas can be useful in all steps of the data scientific method, from exploratory data analysis to data wrangling, preprocessing, building models and visualization. Here we will see its great utility in importing flat files, even merely in the way that it deals with missing data, comments along with the many other issues that plague working data scientists. For all of these reasons, it is now standard and best practice in Data Science to use pandas to import flat files as dataframes. Later in this course, we’ll see how many other types of data, whether they’re stored in relational databases, hdf5, MATLAB or excel files, can easily be imported as dataframes.

To use pandas, you first need to import it. Then, if we wish to import a CSV in the most basic case all we need to do is to call the function read_csv() and supply it with a single argument, the name of the file. Having assigned the dataframe to the variable data, we can check the first 5 rows of the dataframe, including the header, with the command data.head(). We can also easily convert to the dataframe to a numpy array by calling the dataframe attribute values.

Now it's your turn to play around importing flat files using Python. You'll get experience importing a flat file that is straighforward and you'll also get experience importing a flat file that has a few issues, such as containing comments & strings that should be interpreted as missing values: have fun importing!","['data science', 'learn python', 'python tutorial', 'python for data science', 'python for data analysis', 'data science tutorials', 'data analysis tutorials', 'data analysis', 'pandas', 'importing data with pandas']",2016-11-09T20:57:27Z,16448,28,,4,PT3M18S,sd,False,135000,21427061,1289

If all the data are numerical, you can use the package numpy to import the data as a numpy array. Why would we want to do this? First off, numpy arrays are the Python standard for storing numerical data. They are efficient, fast and clean. Secondly, numpy arrays are often essential for other packages, such as scikit-learn, a popular Machine Learning package for Python.

Numpy itself has a number of built-in functions that make it far easier and more efficient for us to import data as arrays. Enter the NumPy functions loadtxt and genfromtxt. To use either of these we first need to import NumPy . We then call loadtxt and pass it the filename as the first argument, along with the delimiter as the 2nd argument. Note that the default delimiter is any white space so we’ll usually need to specify it explicitly.

There are a number of additional arguments you may wish to specify. If, for example, your data consists of numerics and your header has strings in it, such as in the MNIST digits data, you will want to skip the first row by calling loadtxt with the argument skiprows = 1; if you want only the 1st and 3rd columns of the data, you’ll want to set usecols= the list containing ints 0 and 2. You can also import different datatypes into NumPy arrays: for example, setting the argument dtype = 'str' will ensure that all entries are imported as strings. Loadtxt is great for basic cases, but tends to break down when we have mixed datatypes, for example, columns consisting of floats AND columns consisting of strings, such as we saw in the Titanic dataset.

Now it's your turn to have fun with loadtxt. You'll also gain hands-on experience with other functions that can handle mixed datatypes. In the next video we’ll see that, although NumPy arrays can handle data of mixed types, the natural place for such data really is the dataframe.","['data science', 'learn python', 'python tutorial', 'python for data science', 'python for data analysis', 'data science tutorials', 'data analysis tutorials', 'data analysis', 'NumPy', 'importing data with NumPy']",2016-11-09T20:51:59Z,29589,127,,5,PT2M22S,sd,False,135000,21427061,1289

Now you know how to import plain text files, we're going to look at flat files, such as titanic.csv, in which each row is a unique passenger onboard and each column is a feature of attribute, such as gender, cabin and ‘suvived or not’.

It is essential for any budding data scientist to know precisely what the term flat file means: flat files are basic text files containing records, that is, table data, without structured relationships. This is in contrast to a relational database, for example, in which columns of distinct tables can be related. We'll get to these later. To be even more precise, flat files consist of records, where by a record we mean a row of fields or attributes, each of which contains at most one item of information. In the flat file titanic.csv, each row or record is a unique passenger onboard and each column is a feature or attribute, such as name, gender and cabin.

It is also essential to note that a flat file can have a header, such as in titanic.csv , which is a row that occurs as the first row and describes the contents of the data columns or states what the corresponding attribues or features in each column are. It will be important to know whether or not your file has a header as it may alter your data import.

The reason that flat files are so important in data science is that we data scientists really honestly like to think in records or rows of attributes.

Now you may have noticed that the file extension was .csv. You may be wondering what this is? Well, CSV is an acronym for comma separated value and it means exactly what it says: the values in each row are separated by commas. Another common extension for a flat file is .txt, which means a text file.

Values in flat files can be separated by characters or sequences of characters other than commas, such as a tab, and the character or characters in question is called a delimiter.

See here an example of a tab-delimited file: the data consists of the famous MNIST digit recognition images, where each row contains the pixel values of a given image. Note that all fields in the MNIST data are numeric, while the titanic.csv also contained strings.

How do we import such files? If they consist entirely of numbers and we want to store them as a numpy array, we could use numpy. If, instead, we want to store the data in a dataframe, we could use pandas. Most of the time, you will use one of these options.

In the rest of this Chapter, you'll learn how to

Import flat files that contain only numerical data, such as the MNIST data;
Import flat files that contain both numerical data and strings, such as titanic.csv.
But first, lets get you to do a couple of quick multiple choice questions to test your knowledege of flat files.","['data science', 'learn python', 'python tutorial', 'python for data science', 'python for data analysis', 'data science tutorials', 'data analysis tutorials', 'data analysis', 'flat files', 'importing flat files']",2016-11-09T20:49:32Z,15526,48,,0,PT3M11S,sd,False,135000,21427061,1289

Welcome to Importing Data in Python! My name is Hugo Bowne-Anderson and I am a Data Scientist at DataCamp. As a Data Scientist, on a daily basis you will need to clean data, wrangle and munge it, visualize it, build predictive models and interpret these models. But before doing any of this, you will need to know how to get data into Python. There are many common sources of data that you'll need to import into Python: (i) flat files such as .txts and .csvs; (ii) files native to other software such as Excel spreadsheets, Stata, SAS and MATLAB files; (iii) relational databases such as SQLite & PostgreSQL; (iv) data from the world wide web and (v) a special and essential case of this: pulling data from Application Programming Interfaces, also known as APIs, such as the Twitter streaming API, which allows us to stream real-time tweets. We’ll cover all of these topics in this course.

First off, however, we're going to learn how to import basic text files, which we can broadly classify into 2 types of files:

Those containing plain text, such as the opening of Mark Twain's novel The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which you can see here;
Those containing records, that is, table data, such as titanic.csv, in which each row is a unique passenger onboard and each column is a characteristic or feature, such as gender, cabin and ‘survived or not’.
The latter is known as a flat file and we'll come back to these in a minute.

In this section, we'll figure out how to read lines from a plain text file: So let's do it! To check out any plain text file, you can use Python’s basic open() function to open a connection to the file. To do so, you

Assign the filename to a variable as a string;
Pass the filename to the function open() and also pass it the argument mode = 'r', which makes sure that we can only read it (we wouldn't want to accidentally write to it!);
Assign the text from the file to a variable text by applying the method read() to the connection to the file;
After you do this, make sure that you close the connection to the file using the command file.close(). It’s always best practice to clean while cooking!
You can then print the file to console and check it out using the command print(text).

A brief side note: if you wanted to open a file in order to write to it, you would pass it the argument mode = 'w'. We won't use that in this course as this is course on Importing Data but it is good to know.

You can avoid having to close the connection to the file by using a with statement:

This allows you to create a context in which you can execute commands with the file open. Once out of this clause/context, the file is no longer open and, for this reason, with is called a Context Manager.

What you're doing here is called 'binding' a variable in the context manager construct; while still within this construct, the variable file will be bound to open(filename, 'r'). It is best practice to use the with statement as you never have to concern yourself with closing the files again.

In the following interactive coding sessions, you’ll figure out how to print files to console; you’ll also learn to print specific lines, which can be very useful for large files. Then we’ll be back to discuss flat files and then I'll show you how to use the Python package NumPy to make our job of importing flat files & numerical data a far easier beast to tame: enjoy!","['data science', 'learn python', 'python tutorial', 'python for data science', 'python for data analysis', 'data science tutorials', 'data analysis tutorials', 'importing data in python', 'importing data']",2016-11-09T20:37:30Z,12082,22,,1,PT1M10S,sd,False,135000,21427061,1289

Welcome to the Python Data Science Toolbox! My name is Hugo Bowne-Anderson and I'm a Data Scientist at DataCamp. These courses are for those who have taken DataCamp's introductory Python courses and are itching to develop their Python data science skills further. You are already versed in the basics of Python variables and know about ints, floats, strings and booleans, all essential building blocks for budding Pythonistas. You're also familiar with lists and dictionaries, objects which you'll invariably use to store data in your work. You have learnt about functions and packages, how to use numpy to store, access and manipulate numerical data. You know about control flow, pandas DataFrames and how to plot with matplotlib, along with having had a deep dive into hacker statistics.

It's now time to push forward and develop your Python chops even further. There are lots and lots of fantastic functions in Python and its library ecosystem. However, as a Data Scientist, you'll constantly need to write your own functions to solve problems that are dictated by your data. The art of function writing is what you'll learn in this first Python Data Science toolbox course. You'll come out of this course being able to write your very own custom functions, complete with multiple parameters and multiple return values, along with default arguments and flexible arguments. You'll gained insight into scoping in Python and be able to write lambda functions and handle errors in your very own function writing practice. On top of this, you'll wrap up each Chapter by diving into using your acquired skills to write functions that analyze twitter DataFrames and are generalizable to broader Data Science contexts. But don't take my word for it. Take the course instead!

Congratulations: you're now a bonafide Python function writer. On top of that, you have just written your very first Data Sciencey function.

At this point, although you can write basic functions, you've really just touched the surface of function writing capabilities. In the following Chapters, you'll learn how to write functions that have default arguments so that when you call them, you don't always have to specify all the parameters; you'll learn how to write functions that can accept an arbitrary number of parameters and how to nest functions within one another; on top of this, you'll learn how to handle errors when writing functions, which will make your functions as robust as they need to be. Moreover, you'll see the importance of such techniques in Data Science by writing functions that are pertinent to the Data Science sphere like the Twitter DataFrame analysis that you just performed.

Congrats! So now you're able to write functions that accept multiple parameters and return multiple values, it is time to see how these learnt skills can be valuable in a Data Science context. In the following exercises, you'll write a function that analyzes a DataFrame of twitter data. The function that you'll write will return a dictionary containing data of how many times each language was used across all the tweets in the DataFrame. We'll see later in this course that we can generalize such a function to count occurences of any items in a DataFrame column. Let's recap the basic ingredients of a function:

We have a function header which begins with the keyword def; this is followed by the function name, parameters in parentheses and a colon. We then have the function body, which contains docstrings enclosed in triple quotation marks; docstrings describe what the function does; the rest of the function body performs the computation that the function does; the function body closes with the keyword return, followed by the value or values returned by the function. That's it from me.

Welcome back! You're doing great at defining your own functions. Good job!

At this point, you already know how to define your own functions and even return values from them. What you'll learn next is how to pass multiple arguments to functions, as well as return not just one, but multiple values from them.

Let's tweak the square() function we've been working on a little bit more. Suppose that, instead of simply squaring a value, we'd like to raise a value to the power of another value that's also passed to the function. We can do this by having our function accept two parameters instead of just one. You should also change your function name AND docstrings to reflect this new behavior. raise_to_power is an appropriate function name.

Notice that there are now two parameters in the function header instead of one, value1 and value2. In the lines after that, the behavior of the overall function was also changed by raising value1 to the power of value2.

You can call the function by passing in two arguments because the function has two parameters, as declared in the function header. The order in which the arguments are passed correspond to the order of the parameters in the function header. This means that when we call raise_to_power(2, 3), when the function is executed, 2 would be assigned to value1 and 3 to value2. Looking at the function body, this means that the computation value1 to the power of value2 translates to 2 to the power of 3. This function call then returns the value 8.

You can also make your function return multiple values. You can do that by constructing objects known as tuples in your functions.

A tuple is like a list, in that it can contain multiple values. There are some differences, however:

Firstly, unlike a list, a tuple is immutable, that is, you cannot modify the values in a tuple once it has been constructed.
Secondly, while lists are defined using square brackets [], tuples are constructed using a set of parentheses ().
Here we construct a tuple containing 3 elements.

You can also unpack a tuple into several variables in one line. Doing so means that you assign to the variables a, b, and c the tuple values, in the order that they appear in the tuple. Additionally, you can also access individual tuple elements like you do with lists. Doing this here accesses the second element of the tuple. Why is that? Recall that with lists, you can use zero-indexing to access list elements. You can do the same thing with tuples! Pretty cool, right?

Let's now modify the behavior of your raise() function. Instead of returning just the value of value1 raised to the power of value2, let's also return the value of value2 raised to the power of value1. You thus need to make raise() return two values instead of one. We can use what we now know of Tuples to do this!

We first change the name of our function and the docstring to reflect the new behavior of our function. We then, in the function body, construct a tuple consisting of the values we want the function to return and, also in the function body, we return the tuple!

Calling the function constructed demonstrates that it does exactly what we want! Now it's your turn to play with writing function that accept multiple arguments and return multiple values.

Welcome to the course! My name is Hugo Bowne-Anderson and I am a Data Scientist at DataCamp. In this course, the first of the Python Data Science toolbox courses, you'll learn to write your very own functions and you'll have the opportunity to apply these newfound skills to questions that commonly arise in Data Science contexts.

Specifically, in this video and in the interactive exercises that follow it, you will learn to do the following:

define functions without parameters,
define functions with single parameters, and
define functions that return a single value.
In the next section, you'll learn how to pass multiple arguments to functions, as well as return multiple values from them.

Let's begin!

Let's check out Python's built-in function str(), which accepts an object such as a number and returns a string object. You can assign a call to str() to a variable to store its return value.

While built-in Python functions are cool, as a Data Scientist, you'll need functions that have functionality specific to your needs. Fortunately, you can define your own functions in Python!

We'll now see how to define functions via an example, a function that squares a number. The function name square will be perfect for this. To define the function, We begin with the keyword def, followed by the function name square; this is then followed by a set of parentheses and a colon. This piece of code is called a function header.

To complete the function definition, let's write the function body by squaring a value, say 4, and printing the output.

Right now, our square function does not have any parameters within the parentheses (). We will add them later. Now, whenever this function is called, the code in the function body is run. In this case, new_value is assigned the value of 4 ** 2 and then printed out.

You can call the function as you do with pre-built functions: square(). This should yield the value, 16.

What if you wanted to square any other number besides 4, though? To add that functionality, you add a parameter to the function definition in between the parentheses. Here you see that we've added a parameter value and in the new function body, the variable new_value takes the square of value, which is then printed out. We can now square any number that we pass to the function square as an argument.

A quick word on parameters and arguments:

When you define a function, you write parameters in the function header.
When you call a function, you pass arguments into the function.
The function square now accepts a single parameter and prints out its squared value. But what if we don't want to print that value directly and instead we want to return the squared value and assign it to some variable? You can have your function return the new value by adding the return keyword, followed by the value to return. Now we can assign to a variable num the result of the function call as you see here.

There's another essential aspect of writing functions in Python: docstrings. Docstrings are used to describe what your function does, such as the computations it performs or its return values. These descriptions serve as documentation for your function so that anyone who reads your function's docstring understands what your function does, without having to trace through all the code in the function definition.

Function docstrings are placed in the immediate line after the function header and are placed in between triple quotation marks. An appropriate Docstring for our function square is 'Returns the square of a value'.

You've now just learned the basics of defining your own functions! Now it's your turn. In the next few exercises, you will try your hand at defining and using your own functions.","['data science', 'data data analysis', 'learn python', 'python tutorial', 'python for data science', 'python for data analysis', 'data science tutorials', 'data analysis tutorials', 'functions', 'writing functions', 'big data']",2016-11-09T19:49:29Z,42008,338,,13,PT3M57S,sd,False,135000,21427061,1289

Creating a plot is one thing. Making the correct plot, that makes the message very clear, is the real challenge. For each visualization, you have many options. First of all, there are the different plot types. And for each plot, you can do an infinite number of customizations. You can change colors, shapes, labels, axes, and so on. The choice depends on, one, the data, and two, the story you want to tell with this data.

Since there are a so many possible customizations, the best way to learn this, is by example. Let's start with the code in this script to build a simple line plot. It's similar to the line plot we've created in the first video, but this time the year and pop lists contain more data, including projections until the year 2100, forecasted by the United Nations.

If we run this script, we already get a pretty nice plot: it shows that the population explosion that's going on, will have slowed down by the end of the century. But some things can be improved. First, it should be clearer which data we are displaying, especially to people who are seeing the graph for the first time. And second, the plot really needs to draw the attention to the population explosion.

The first thing you always need to do is label your axes. Let's do this by adding the xlabel() and ylabel() functions. As inputs, we pass strings that should be placed alongside the axes. Make sure to call these functions before calling the show() method, otherwise your customizations will not be displayed. If we run the script again, this time the axes are annotated.

We're also going to add a title to our plot, with the title function. We pass the actual title, 'World Population Projections', as an argument. And there's the title! So, using xlabel, ylabel and title, we can give the reader more information about the data on the plot: now they can at least tell what the plot is about.

To put the population growth in perspective, I want to have the y-axis start from zero. You can do this with the yticks() function. The first input is a list, in this example with the numbers zero up to ten, with intervals of 2. If we run this, the plot will change: the curve shifts up. Now it's clear that already in 1950, there were already about 2.5 billion people on this planet.

Next, to make it clear we're talking about billions, we can add a second argument to the yticks function, which is a list with the display names of the ticks. This list should have the same length as the first list. The tick 0 gets the name 0, the tick 2 gets the name 2B, the tick 4 gets the name 4B and so on. By the way, B stands for Billions here. If we run this version of the script, the labels will change accordingly, great.

Finally, let's add some more historical data to accentuate the population explosion in the last 60 years. On wikipedia, I found the world population data for the years 1800, 1850 and 1900. I can write them in list form and append them to the pop and year lists with the plus sign. If I now run the script once more, three datapoints are added to the graph, giving a more complete picture.

Now that's how you turn an average line plot into a visual that has a clear story to tell! Over to you now. Head over to the exercises, gradually customize the world development chart and become the next Hans Rosling!","['python', 'data science', 'data data analysis', 'learn python', 'python tutorial', 'python for data science', 'python for data analysis', 'data science tutorials', 'data analysis tutorials', 'big data', 'matplotlib', 'visualization', 'Customizing plots with python matplotlib', 'DataCamp', 'Python Tutorial', 'want to learn Python', 'Data Science', 'how to learn data science']",2016-11-09T18:49:00Z,51261,293,,8,PT3M13S,sd,False,135000,21427061,1289

In this video, I'll introduce the histogram. The histogram is a type of visualization that's very useful to explore your data. It can help you to get an idea about the distribution of your variables. To see how it works, imagine 12 values between 0 and 6. I've put them along a number line here. To build a histogram for these values, you can divide the line into equal chunks, called bins. Suppose you go for 3 bins, that each has a width of 2. Next, you count how many data points sit inside each bin. There are 4 data points in the first bin, 6 in the second bin and 2 in the third bin. Finally, you draw a bar for each bin. The height of the bar corresponds to the number of data points that fall in this bin.

The result is a histogram, which gives us a nice overview of how the 12 values are distributed. Most values are in the middle, but there are more values below 2 than there are values above 4.

Of course, also matplotlib is able to build histograms. As before, you should start by importing the pyplot package that's inside matplotlib. Next, you can use the hist() function. Let's open up its documentation. There's a bunch of arguments you can specify, but the first two here are the most important ones. x should be a list of values you want to build a histogram for. You can use the second argument, bins, to tell Python how many bins the data should be divided. Based on this number, hist() will automatically find appropriate boundaries for all bins, and calculate how may values are in each one. If you don't specify the bins argument, it will be 10 by default.

So to generate the histogram that you've seen before, let's start by building a list with the 12 values. Next, you simply call hist() and pass this list as an input, so it's matched to the argument x. I also specified the bins argument to be 3, so that the values are divided into three bins. If you finally call the show function, a nice histogram results.

Histograms are really useful to give a bigger picture. As an example, have a look at this so-called population pyramid. The age distribution is shown, for both males and females, in the European union. Notice that the histograms are flipped 90 degrees; the bins are horizontal now. The bins are largest for the ages 40 to 44, where there are 20 million males and 20 million females. They are the so called baby boomers. These are figures of the year 2010. What do you think will have changed in 2050? Let's have a look. The distribution is flatter, and the baby boom generation has gotten older. With the blink of an eye, you can easily see how demographics will be changing over time. That's the true power of histograms at work here!

Now head over to the exercises to experiment with histograms yourself!

The better you understand your data, the better you'll be able to extract insights. And once you've found those insights, again, you'll need visualization to be able to share your precious insights with other people. As an example, have a look at this beautfil plot.

It's made by the Swedish professor Hans Rosling. His talks about global development have been viewed millions of times. And what makes them so intriguing, is that by making beautiful plots, he allows the data to tell their own story. Here we see a bubble chart, where each bubble represents a country. The bigger the bubble, the bigger the country's population, so the two biggest bubbles here are China and India.

There are 2 axes. The horizontal axis shows the GDP per capita, in US dollars. The vertical axis shows life expectancy. We clearly see that people live longer in countries with a higher GDP per capita. Still, there is a huge difference in life expectancy between countries on the same income level.

Now why do I tell you all of this? Well, because by the end of this chapter, you'll be able to build this beautiful plot yourself!

There are many visualization packages in python, but the mother of them all, is matplotlib. You will need its subpackage pyplot. By convention, this subpackage is imported as plt, like this.

For our first example, let's try to gain some insights in the evolution of the world population. I have a list with years here, year, and a list with corresponding populations, expressed in billions, pop. In the year 1970, for example, 3.7 billion people lived on planet Earth.

To plot this data as a line chart, we call plt.plot() and use our two lists as arguments. The first argument corresponds to the hozontal axis, and the second one to the vertical axis. You might think that a plot will pop up right now, but Python's pretty lazy. It will wait for the show() function to actually display the plot. This is because you might want to add some extra ingredients to your plot before actually displaying it, such as titles and label customizations. I'll talk about that some more later on. Just remember this: the plot() function tells Python what to plot and how to plot it. show() actually displays the plot.

When we look at our plot, we see that the years are indeed shown on the horizontal axis, and the populations on the vertical axis. There are four datapoints, and Python draws a line between them. In 1950, the world population was around 2 point 5 billion. In 2010, it was around 7 billion. So the world population has almost tripled in sixty years, that's pretty scary. What if the population keeps on growing like that? Will the world become over populated? You'll find out in the exercises.

Let me first introduce you to another type of plot: the scatter plot. To create it, we can start from the code from before. This time, though, you change the plot function to scatter. The resulting scatter plot simply plots all the individual datapoints; Python doesn't connect the dots with a line. For many applications, the scatter plot is often a better choice than the line plot, so remember this scatter function well. You could also say that this is a more -honest- way of plotting your data, because you can clearly see that the plot is based on just four data points.
 
Now that we've got the basics of matplotlib covered, it's your turn to build some awesome plots!","['python', 'python for data science', 'data science', 'matplotlib', 'learn python', 'python tutorial', 'data data analysis', 'python for data analysis', 'data science tutorials', 'data analysis tutorials', 'big data', 'histogram', 'statistics', 'Intermediate Python', 'DataCamp', 'Python Tutorial', 'want to learn Python', 'Data Science', 'how to learn data science']",2016-11-09T18:28:14Z,90462,445,,22,PT3M53S,sd,False,135000,21427061,1289

In this R video tutorial we will learn to Create, Modify and Work with Vectors and Matrices in R.

▶︎▶︎Reminder: One of the important features of R is that it can handle complex statistical operations in an easy and efficient way. R handles complex computations using Vectors, Matrices, Lists, Dataframes and Datasets; In this video we focus on Vectors and Matrices in R. In R, Vector is a basic data structure that contains element of similar type (logical, integer, double, character, complex or raw). A matrix is basically a two-way generalization of a vector. Instead of a single index, we can use two indexes, one representing a row and the second representing a column.

▶︎▶︎In this R tutorial you will learn:
▶︎ How to create vectors in R for numbers or objects using the c function or concatenate function
▶︎ How to use seq function to create sequence data in R 
▶︎ How to use rep function in R to create a vector of repeated numbers or characters 
▶︎ How to create a matrix using matrix function in R and use square brackets to extract certain elements from a matrix in R
▶︎ How to perform basic arithmetic functions on the elements of one vector, preform arithmetic functions on the corresponding elements of two vectors and perform element-wise arithmetic functions in a matrix in R Statistical software.

This video is a tutorial for programming in R Statistical Software for beginners.

When working with a large data set, you might only be interested in a small portion of it. How do you sort through all the variables and observations and extract only the data that you need? R has several ways of sorting and selecting data in a process that is called “subsetting.” Brackets in R lets you select, or subset, data from a vector, matrix, array, list or data frame. 

R’s operators can be summarized as:
• [ for subsets,
• [[ for extracting items, and
• $ for extracting by name.

In this R tutorial video, we focus on subsetting data from a vector and matrix in R.

Learn how to use the ""apply()"" function in R, to apply a function to all rows or columns of a data frame. The apply function essentially is a specialized loop function, although it is more efficient than a simple for-loop. You will also learn the use of the ""ColMeans"", ""ColSums"", ""RowMeans"", and ""RowSums"" functions in R.

In this R video tutorial we will learn how to use the ""tapply()"" function in R, to apply a function to subsets of a variable or vector. The tapply function essentially is a specialized loop/subsetting function, although it is more efficient than simple use of sure brackets or a ""subset"" command. The tapply function allows the user to divide a variable into multiple groups based on another variable(s) used to define the groups/subsets, and then apply a function to each of the groups/subsets.

In this R video tutorial, we will learn how to produce box plots (a.k.a. box and whisker diagram) in R, as well as ""side by side boxplots"" for multiple groups (i.e. boxplots with groups) with examples. In this R tutorial we will also learn how to add titles, change axes labels, and many other modifications to the plot by using ""boxplot"", ""~"", ""ylim"", and ""quantile"" functions and ""xlab"", ""ylab"", ""ylim"", ""las"" arguments.

In this R video tutorial, we will learn how to create side by side boxplots comparing groups that are stratified using a third variable. In this tutorial we will also learn to enhance the plots by adding titles, changing axes labels, adding legends and changing colours of the plots. We will also see how to use the ""*"" to stratify the box plots and the ""las"" argument.  


In descriptive statistics, a box plot or boxplot is a method for graphically summarizing the distribution of a numerical (quantitative or continuous) variable through its quartiles, minimum, maximum, and outliers. The “box” portion of the plot visually displays the first quartile, median, and third quartile.  The “whiskers” or lines that extend from the box display the minimum and maximum value that are not considered to be outliers. 


Box plots for two factors are a way of comparing the distribution for a numeric (quantitative or continuous) variable, stratified based on 2 factors.  For example, we may wish to compare the distribution of body temperature (Y) for males and females (X1), as well as young and old (X2).  Here, the “Body Temperature” would be the “Y” variable, “Biological Sex” would be the first factor or “X1”, and “Categorized Age (young/old)” would be the second factor or “X2”.  Here, a desirable visual display would be to have a boxplot of body temperature for young males, next to a boxplot of body temperature for young females, next to a boxplot of body temperature for old males, next to a boxplot of body temperature for old females.  It may also be desirable to have the plot colour coded, to have the male boxplots appear in one color, and the female boxplots to appear in a different color.  In this video we show how to make such a plot in R.

Sometimes two or more groups of observations are displayed on a single plot. Legends help us identify each set; they make reading and interpreting graphs easier. In this R video tutorial, we will learn how to add legends to plots made in R and change the symbols/characters used in the legends as well as the look and location of the legends. This R tutorial explains how to use the ""legend"" fucntion, and the ""fill"", ""col"", ""bty"", ""pch"" and ""lty"" arguments in R programming software for creating and customizing legends in R.

In this R video tutorial, we will learn how to calculate probabilities for Poisson Random Variables in R.  Similar to the normal distribution, the Poisson distribution is a theoretical probability distribution.  It is often used to model events that occur over time (or over space), with the random variable being the number of occurrences of the event for a specified period of time (or space).

Here we will use functions and arguments such as ""ppois"", ""dpois"", ""rpois"" and ""sum"" function.

In this R video lecture, we will learn how to conduct the one-sample t-test and confidence interval for the mean of a single variable.  Here we will use various R functions and arguments such as ""t.test"", ""boxplot"", ""attributes"", ""$"", “conf”, “alt” and more.

One sample t test in statistics is also know as single sample t test. The one sample t test and confidence interval are parametric methods appropriate for examining a single numeric variable.

In this R video tutorial, we will learn how to conduct the independent two-sample t-test and confidence interval for the difference in means of two populations. We will use various R functions and arguments to perform two sample t-test such as ""t.test"" function, ""boxplot"", ""var.eq"" and ""leveneTest"" and more.

Independent two sample t-test and confidence interval are parametric methods appropriate for examining the difference in means for two populations. These are ways of examining the relationship between a numeric outcome variable (Y variable) and a categorical explanatory variable (X variable with 2 levels)

In this R video tutorial, we will learn how to conduct the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum (aka Mann-Whitney U) test using R statistical software. This is the non-parametric alternative to the independent t-test. Wilcoxon Rank-Sum (Mann-Whitney U) test is appropriate for examining the difference in medians for two independent populations. It is a way of examining the relationship between a numeric outcome variable (Y variable) and a categorical explanatory variable (X variable with 2 levels) when groups are independent. In this video we will learn to use R functions and arguments such as ""wilcox.test"", ""exact"", ""correct"", “conf.int”, “conf.level”, “paired”, and more.


These video tutorials are useful for anyone interested in learning data science and statistics with R programming language using RStudio.

►In this R video tutorial, we will learn how to use R to perform a hypothesis test using a bootstrap approach.
► Bootstrapping in statistics is a resampling based approach useful for estimating the sampling distribution and standard error of an estimate. 
► Bootstrapping in statistics and in research provides an alternative approach to approaches based on large sample theory (you may recall that many approaches rely on having a large n in order to carry out the method). It becomes particularly useful when dealing with more complicated estimates, where their sampling distribution and/or standard error may not be easily calculated

► We will focus on comparing the means (and medians) of two different groups, although we present the approach in a more general way, so that you can test a hypothesis about any other estimate/statistic calculated from your data.

► An R package does exist for bootstrap hypothesis testing (package name: boot), although the package is limited in the sorts of estimates/statistics it can conduct a bootstrap approach for.  Our goal is to show you how to build the bootstrap approach yourself, so that you can make changes to the sorts of statistics/estimates you conduct tests for.  You can practice building the test yourself, and then compare the results to what you get using the ""boot"" package in R. Note that if you do this, numeric values will differ slightly because you and the package will end up with a different set of bootstrap samples, and so there will be a slight numeric difference in results.

What to Expect:

►In this R video tutorial, we learn how to use R programming language to generate a confidence interval using a bootstrap approach, Step by Step with no R Package 
► In this R tutorial we will focus on comparing the means (and medians) of two different groups or samples
► R packages do exist for bootstrapping in R (one package name: boot), although the package is limited in the sorts of estimates/statistics it can conduct a bootstrap approach for. Our goal is to show you how to build the bootstrap approach yourself, so that you can change  the sorts of statistics/estimates you can work with.  
► You can always practice building the interval yourself, and then comparing the results to what you get using the ""boot"" package in R. Note that if you do this, numeric values will differ slightly because you and the package will end up with a different set of bootstrap samples, and so there will be a slight numeric difference in results.

General Overview:

► Bootstrapping in statistics is a resampling based approach useful for estimating the sampling distribution and standard error of an estimate
► Bootstrapping provides an alternative approach to approaches based on large-sample theory (you may recall that many approaches rely on having a large n in order to carry out the method). 
► Bootstrapping becomes particularly useful when dealing with more complicated estimates, where their standard error may not be easily calculated, or the shape of their sampling distribution is not easy to estimate
► Many classic approaches make inferences about means/medians, etc.  Bootstrapping opens the door to working with much more interesting, and informative, estimates

In this R video tutorial, we show how to do a permutation hypothesis test in R, using an example where we would like to compare a numeric (quantitative, continuous) variable for two groups formed by a categorical variable (qualitative, factor).  A permutation test is considered an “exact” test, as it calculates an exact p value (although in practice, we often take a random sample of all possible permutations, and so it is no longer truly an exact test)

A permutation test in statistics starts by assuming a null hypothesis to be true, and then considers all possible permutations of the data, under the assumption that the null is true.  The p value is then calculated as the percentage of test statistics, calculated for each of the permutation data sets, that are greater than the observed (or sample) test-statistic.

In this R video, we show how to implement such a test in R statistical software.  We make the R code as transparent as possible, and include some extra R code to explore at the end of the R script for the video.

In this R video tutorial, we will learn how to conduct the paired t-test (matched pairs t-test or dependent t test) in R. This test is used to compare the means of two paired or dependent populations. It essentially becomes the univariate (one sample) t test, by taking the difference in observations in the 2 groups, and then conducting a test on the mean difference.  

The paired t-test and confidence interval in statistics are parametric methods appropriate for examining the difference in means for 2 populations that are paired or dependent on one another. We will learn to use various functions and arguments in R statistical software such as ""t.test”, ""paired"", ""conf.level"", ""boxplot"", “mu”, and more to perform this test.


These video tutorials are useful for anyone interested in learning data science and statistics with R programming language using RStudio.

In this R programming video tutorial, we will learn how to conduct the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test in R. The paired samples Wilcoxon test (or Wilcoxon Signed Rank test) can be thought of as a non-parametric alternative to the paired sample t-test or dependent-samples t test. It is used when your data are not normally distributed. 
Wilcoxon Signed Rank test is appropriate for examining the median difference in observations for two populations that are paired or dependent on one another. In other words the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test is used to test if the median difference between two paired or dependent groups is significantly different from 0!

In this R statistical video we will use various R functions and arguments to perform Wilcoxon Signed Rank test such as ""wilcox.test"", ""boxplot"", ""exact"", ""alt"", ""conf.int"", and ""correct"". 


These video tutorials are useful for anyone interested in learning data science and statistics with R programming language using RStudio.

In this R video tutorial, we will learn how to conduct the Pearson’s chi-square test of independence and Fisher's Exact test in R; we will also learn to produce cross tabulations using R programming language. 
Pearson's chi square test of independence and Fisher’s exact test can be used to test if two variables are independent or dependent and is often used with categorical data. The Chi-Square Test can also be used to test how well a particular distribution fits a set of observed data and is referred to as Pearson's Goodness of Fit Test.

Chi Squared test works by comparing the observed contingency table, to what the table would be expected to look like, if the null hypothesis is true, and X and Y are independent. While Chi-Square Test technically is referred to as a non-parametric test, the assumptions and approach to the test look more like a parametric test. If the null hypothesis is rejected, this test tells us nothing about the strength or direction of the association between X and Y, and we must use other measures of association to try and address this.

Fisher's exact test is an alternative to the chi-square test of independence, which doesn't rely on large sample theory

Cross-tabulation ( contingency tables or cross tabs) displays the frequency distribution of the variables to understand the correlation between them. It also shows how correlations change from one variable grouping to another. It is usually used in statistical analysis to find patterns, trends, and probabilities within raw data

In this R video tutorial, we will learn how to calculate the relative risk, odds ratio and risk difference (also known as attributable risk) using the epiR package in R.  These are numeric summaries for analyzing 2x2 tables, also known as cross-tabulations. Risk Difference, Relative Risk, and Odds Ratio measure the association between 2 categorical variables (or factors). 

Odds Ratio, Relative Risk, and Risk Difference are all slightly different ways of describing the association between two categorical variables. The Relative Risk also gets referred to as a Risk Ratio, Rate Ratio, Incidence Rate Ratio, or Prevalence Rate Ratio. The Risk Difference also gets referred to as the Attributable Risk.

These video tutorials are useful for anyone interested in learning data science and statistics with R programming language using RStudio.

In this R video we will learn how to calculate Pearson's correlation, Spearman's rank correlation, and Kendall's rank correlation, create confidence intervals and hypothesis tests and calculate Covariance in R.
Here we will be using ""cor"", ""cor.test"",""cov"" ,""pairs"", method”, functions and arguments in R and more.

Pearson’s correlation is a parametric measure of the linear association between two numeric variables, Spearman’s rank correlation is a non-parametric measure of the monotonic association between two numeric variables, Kendall’s rank correlation is another non-parametric measure of the association based on concordance or discordance of x-y pairs. Covariance is a measure of the joint variability of two random variables.

How to fit a Linear Regression Model in R, Produce Summaries and ANOVA table for it. 

◼︎ What to Expect in this R video Tutorial:

► learn when to use a regression model, and how to use the “lm” function in R to fit a linear regression model for your data 
► learn to produce summaries for your regression model using “summary” function in R statistics software; these summaries can include intercept, test statistic, p value, and estimates of the slope for your linear regression model
► become familiar with the Residual Error:  a measure of the variation of observations in regression line 
► learn to ask R programming software for the attributes of the simple linear regression model using ""attributes"" function, extract certain attributes from the regression model using the dollar sign ($), add a regression line to a plot in R using ""abline"" function and change the color or width of the regression line.
► this R tutorial will also show you how to get the simple linear regression model's coefficient using the ""coef"" function or produce confidence intervals for the regression model using ""confint"" functions; moreover, you will learn to change the level of confidence using the ""level"" argument within the ""confint"" function.
►You will also learn to produce the ANOVA table for the linear regression model using the ""anova"" function, explore the relationship between ANOVA table and the f-test of the regression summary, and explore the relationship between the residual standard error of the linear regression summary and the square root of the mean squared error or mean squared residual from the ANOVA table.

How to test linear regression assumptions in R?

In this R tutorial, we will first go over some of the concepts for linear regression like how to add a regression line, how to interpret the regression line (predicted or fitted Y value, the mean of Y given X), how to interpret the residuals or errors (the difference between observed Y value and the predicted or fitted Y value) and the assumptions when fitting a linear regression model.
Then we will discuss the regression diagnostic plots in R, the reason for making diagnostic plots, and how to produce these plots in R; You will learn to check the linearity assumption and constant variance (homoscedasticity) for a regression model with residual plots in R and test the assumption of normality in R with QQ (Quantile Quantile) plots. You will also learn to check the constant variance assumption for data with non-constant variance in R, produce and interpret residual plots, QQ plots, and scatterplots for data with non-constant variance, and produce and interpret residual plots, QQ plots, and scatterplots for data with non-linear relationship in R.

In this R video tutorial we will learn to create a categorical variable (a factor or qualitative variable) from a numeric variable in R using the ""cut"" command (function). In this R video you will also learn how to label the categories and make the intervals left-closed or right-opened using the ""labels"" and ""right"" arguments.
Transforming data, converting a continuous variables into categorical variable or factors, is useful for making cross-tabulations for a variable, fitting a regression model when the linearity is not valid for the variable and more.

In this R video tutorial, we learn what dummy or indicator variables are and how they are used to include categorical or qualitative variables or factors into a regression model in R.
To consider a categorical variable as a predictor in a regression model, we create indicator variables to represent the categories that are not the reference. 

Note:  If you include a categorical variable into a regression model in R, R will automatically create dummy variables for it.  For example, if X1 is a numeric variable and X2 is a categorical variable with 4 levels, if you fit a linear regression model lm(Y ~ X1 + X2), R will automatically create the necessary 3 dummy variables for X2 when fitting the model.

The video provides a tutorial for programming in R Statistical Software for beginners.

►In a linear regression model the intercept or constant term refers to the estimated mean Y-value for the reference or baseline group, and the model coefficients or parameters refer to expected changes in the mean Y-value relative to the reference group. For example, if X is a categorical variable (or a factor) with levels A, B, C, then the intercept will refer to level A, and there will be a coefficient for level B (b_B) which estimates the change in the mean for level B relative to level A, and there will be a coefficient for level C (b_C) which estimates the change in the mean for level C relative to level A.  By default, R chooses the category that comes first alphabetically or numerically (alphanumerically) as the reference category. In this video, we show how to use the relevel command (function) to change the reference category in R statistical software for a categorical variable (a factor). In this example, we may wish to make level B (or level C) the reference category.

In this R video tutorial, we will learn how to include interaction or effect modification in a regression model and how to interpret the model coefficients. 

In statistics, an interaction may arise when considering the relationship among three or more variables and describes a situation in which the effect of one causal variable on an outcome depends on the state of a second causal variable (that is, when effects of the two causes are not additive). Although commonly thought of in terms of causal relationships, the concept of interaction can also describe non-causal associations. Interactions are often considered in the context of regression analyses or factorial experiments.

The Partial F-test (also know as incremental F-test or an extra sum of squares F-test) is a useful tool for variable selection when building a regression model.  You will also learn what the Sum of Square Error is, and its use in The Partial F-test. 

The partial F- test is used to determine whether the extra variables provide enough extra explanatory power as a group to warrant their inclusion in the equation. In other words, the partial F-test tests whether the full model is significantly better than the reduced model. 

An F-test is any statistical test in which the test statistic has an F-distribution under the null hypothesis. It is most often used when comparing statistical models that have been fitted to a data set, in order to identify the model that best fits the population from which the data were sampled.

In this R video tutorial, we will learn how to fit the polynomial regression model and assess Polynomial Regression in R using the partial F-test with examples.  

Polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable X and the dependent variable Y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial in x. Polynomial regression models are useful when the relationship between the independent variables(X)  and the dependent variables(Y) is not linear.

In this video we walk through web scraping in Python using the beautiful soup library. We start with a brief introduction to HTML & CSS and discuss what web scraping is. Next we start getting into the basics of the beautiful soup library. This includes how to load a webpage, the basic commands you need to know such as find & find_all, grabbing strings from an HTML elements, etc. The final section of this tutorial is a series of exercises where you can practice your skills. In this section we scrape a webpage for links, we learn how to scrape a table and load it into a pandas dataframe, and we see how you can scrape & download a web image. Hope you enjoy!

I’m looking into making future videos on more complex things you can do with web scraping as well as other libraries that are helpful such as Selenium & ScraPy. Subscribe to not miss those.

Python Pandas Documentation: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/

Let me know if you have any questions!

In this video we walk through many of the fundamental concepts to use the Python Pandas Data Science Library. We start off by installing pandas and loading in an example csv. We then look at different ways to read the data. Read a column, rows, specific cell, etc. Also ways to read data based on conditioning. We then move into some more advanced ways to sort & filter data. We look at making conditional changes to our data. We also start doing aggregate stats using the groupby function. We finished the video talking about how you would work with a very large dataset (many gigabytes)

I realized as I upload this video there are some additional things I want to talk about in a later video. The first thing that comes to mind immediately is using the apply() function on a dataframe to alter the data using a custom or lambda function. If you have questions on this or anything else before I get around to making  a part 2, feel free to write me a note in the comments.

In this video we walk through some of my favorite tips & tricks for doing data science with Jupyter Notebooks. Many of these tips have helped me become more efficient writing Python code for my data science projects. 

Topics covered:
- Running bash commands from a jupyter notebook. You can use “!” in a code cell to run any terminal command that you want. You can also try using the “%” to execute magic lines. This includes some of the same bash commands that you might gravitate to as well as some Jupyter specific commands.
- The most useful shortcuts that I think you should know. Ctrl+enter to run a cell, shift+enter to run a cell and skip to the next, B to create new cells below, M to turn a cell to markdown, and several more. We will also look at find & replace in this section.
- Changing pandas default display settings (number of rows to display, columns, decimal points, etc.)
- Turning on OS alerts for running Jupyter Notebook cells. This is particularly useful if you have a long machine learning model training job going on and you want to know exactly when it finishes so that you can play around with the results.
- Creating slideshows within a Jupyter notebook! 

Bonus topic:
- Changing your Jupyter Notebook theme! Monokai is a good one to use if you like dark-themes

Yay finally posting again. Hopefully this video will help you get comfortable working through the matplotlib library. I'm going to post a follow up video with real-world examples (combining pandas with matplotlib) and different types of plots next week. I originally was going to include that in this one, but I thought the video was getting a bit too long.

In this video we walk through some of the basics of matplotlib. We start by making a simple line graph. We learn how to give the graph a title and label the x & y axis. We learn how to scale the graph by specifying the x & y tickmarks. After this, we restyle our line by passing in keyword arguments then do basically the same thing with a shorthand notation. We resize our graph and save it. Then we end with a simple bar chart.

Install libraries Needed for this video:
Option 1:
Open up a terminal window and type
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install pandas

Option 2:
Download anaconda which will contain all the packages we need. A video on how to do this is here: https://youtu.be/YJC6ldI3hWk

In this video, we go through several real-world examples of using the Matplotlib & Pandas libraries to visualize data from CSV files. This is a follow-up to my introductory matplotlib video (https://youtu.be/DAQNHzOcO5A). Timeline for what we cover can be found in the comments. 

We start by creating line graphs of global gas price data over time. We review how to add a title, x & y axis labels, and scale our graph. We review how to customize the style and size of our charts. Next, we look at the FIFA 19 player data to create a histogram, a couple pie charts, and a box and whisker plot.

In this video we use Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc. 

Setup!
Github source code & data: https://github.com/KeithGalli/Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks 
Installing Jupyter Notebook: https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html 
Installing Pandas library: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html

https://youtu.be/vmEHCJofslg 

Check out the videos I did on Matplotlib:
https://youtu.be/DAQNHzOcO5A
https://youtu.be/0P7QnIQDBJY

Detailed video description! (timeline can be found in comments)

We start by cleaning our data. Tasks during this section include:
- Drop NaN values from DataFrame
- Removing rows based on a condition
- Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

Once we have cleaned up our data a bit, we move the data exploration section. In this section we explore 5 high level business questions related to our data:
- What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
- What city sold the most product?
- What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customer’s buying product?
- What products are most often sold together?
- What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

To answer these questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:
- Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
- Adding columns
- Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
- Using the .apply() method
- Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
- Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
- Labeling our graphs

Datetime library documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html

Detailed video description!
We start by creating a simple dataframe and programmatically adding rows of product purchases to it. We use the random library to select these products.

We make our data more realistic by utilizing normal distributions and geometric distributions in numpy to spread out the number of purchases we make and the quantity of each item purchased.

We use the datetime library to allow us to generate thousands of different times for each purchase with the most common times peaking around 12pm and 8pm.

We take a list of the most common US street addresses to help us randomly generate addresses for each purchases.

In this video we start by walking through some of the basics. We look at why we use neural networks and how they function. We do an overview of network architecture (input layer, hidden layers, output layer). We talk a bit about how you choose how many hidden layers and neurons to have. We also look at hyperparameters like batch size, learning rate, optimizers (adam), activation functions (relu, sigmoid, softmax), and dropout. We finish the first section of the video talking a little about the differences between keras, tensorflow, & pytorch.

Next, we jump into some coding examples to classify data with neural nets. In this section we load in data, do some processing, build our network, fit our data to it, and then finally evaluate our model. The examples get more complex as we go along. Some setup instructions for the coding portion of the video are found below.

To install Tensorflow, download Anaconda: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
Data & code used in tutorial: https://github.com/KeithGalli/neural-nets

I’m going to post a follow up video to this soon where we walk through a real world example where we automatically classify images of hands for the game of rock, paper, scissors. Hopefully that should be up about 2 weeks from now. (EDIT: part 2 has been posted, link below)

(computer vision edition),"In this video we work on a real world computer vision problem using Python. The problem task is to create a model that can distinguish a flower known as “La Eterna” from other types of flowers.

To do this we create convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using the Tensorflow/Keras libraries. We examine how to create a simple model and then improve it using techniques such as data augmentation & preprocessing. We play around with different types of network architectures and see how changes improve or decrease overall task performance.

From the DataCamp website:
The Rebrickable database includes data on every LEGO set that has ever been sold; the names of the sets, what bricks they contain, what color the bricks are, etc. It might be small bricks, but this is big data! In this project, you will get to explore the Rebrickable database and answer a series of questions related to the history of Lego!

Link to Rebrickable database: https://rebrickable.com/downloads/

Some skills worked on in this video:
- Reading CSV files with Python
- Filtering DataFrame based on conditional parameters
- Grouping data by column values and aggregating it

btw, I apologize at about the 25-minute mark I started having microphone issues, I'll have it solved by my next video.

I have gotten quite a few requests to do data science project from scratch. I also left these series mostly unedited so you can see me get stuck and how I figure out the path forward. 

The next phases of the project are, data collection, data cleaning, eda, model building, and productionzation. 

For data science project ideation, you generally have two approaches. You can look through available data on kaggle or google data, or you can come up with an idea and then go out and find your data. In this video, I show you how to do both approaches.

I end up choosing a data science project based on a simple whiteboarding session. We will try to predict data science salaries based on data scraped from glassdoor or linkedin. 

In part 2 I will show you how to scrape your data and how to set up a github repo.

How to set up data science environment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4OPn58BLaU

Data collection can be a tedious and frustrating process, but you don't necessarily have to start from scratch. You should search github to see if someone has already built a web scraper for the website you are looking at. You should also check to see if the website has an open API. 

For this project, I found someone who had written a glassdoor web scraper and I was able to version it for our purposes. The code and the article that I used are linked here:
Code: https://github.com/arapfaik/scraping-glassdoor-selenium
Article: https://towardsdatascience.com/selenium-tutorial-scraping-glassdoor-com-in-10-minutes-3d0915c6d905

This web scraper was written in python with the selinium package. 

This is an iterative process, so in this video you will see how I go about debugging my code and making it work. 

Stay tuned for part 3 where I go through and clean up the data that we collected to make it usable for our EDA and model building. 

After we scrape the data, I save the code to github.

In this video I go through how to clean up your data to make it usable for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model building. 

github repo for this project: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj

Data cleaning is an extremely important and often overlooked step in the data science lifecycle. Python has some handy functions that allow you to parse and replace data relatively easily. You can also use regular expressions to do this; however, those are a bit beyond the scope of this video. I mostly use lambda functions because I think that this is the simplest approach.

The first thing that we clean is the data science salary. We need to make sure that it is numeric because we are using that as our dependent variable. We also want to go through and do some light feature engineering. We can get some info about the state of the job postings and the nature of the job postings themselves.

I went through and looked to see if the postings had python, r-studio, spark, aws, or excel listed and added those as features. 

Again, this is an iterative approach that is rather messy. Please stay tuned for part 4 of the series EDA!

In this video I perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the data that we collected from glassdoor in part 2 and cleaned in part 3. 

github repo for this project: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj

EDA is where we really start understanding our data. It where we start analyzing trends and begin to find insights. 

First, I do some additional data cleaning. I clean up the job titles, and do some feature engineering. 

Next, I look at histograms and box plots of the continuous data fields. This is an important step because we want normal data if we plan to do a regression analysis. 

We then look at the categorical data. We want to see what companies, states, industries, and sectors these jobs are offered in. 

After that, we make some pivot tables to better understand how average salary is different across our categorical categories. 

Finally, we make a word cloud to visualize some of the most common words found in the descriptions. 

Please stay tuned for part 5 where we start building models to predict salary!

653,,,,,,7O4dpR9QMIM,0.4216379188712522,Ken Jee,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"This is part 5 of the Data Science Project from Scratch series. In this video I try a few different models to try to predict the glassdoor salary data that we collected in part 2, cleaned in part 3, and explored in part 4 of this series. 

github repo for this project: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj

When people think about data science, model building is what they usually think about. In this phase, we try multiple different data science algorithms to see which one performs the best. We tune each of these algorithms, and often try multiple at a time to see if we can produce a more accurate result. 

Here, I try a multiple linear regression, a lasso regression, and a random forest regressor. 

I chose to do a lasso regression because the data is fairly sparse, and we would expect a normalized model to perform better. I also selected a random forest because we had many dummy variables. With this type of data, we would also expect a tree based model to perform well. 

Please stay tuned for part 6 where we productionize this model.

In this video I put the salary prediction model that I made in part 5 into production using flask. We make an API endpoint that takes in job posting data and returns an expected salary. 

Article By Chris that we Followed to Create the API: https://towardsdatascience.com/productionize-a-machine-learning-model-with-flask-and-heroku-8201260503d2

github repo for this project: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj

For data science projects, model production is not required, but it can separate you from the pack. It shows that you understand how other people could use your model, and you have made it into a product for them. 

I recommend turning a model into an API endpoint or a small web page at least once for your portfolio. 

Stay tuned for part 7 of this series where I make a github readme for this project.

Docker Compose is a tool that makes running multiple Docker containers much easier, than with Docker run commands. I show you how docker run command compares to a docker compose file and explain step by step  the difference and how it maps from docker run to a docker compose field.

So, basically you can take the whole docker run command with it's configuration and map it into a file. You will get a more structured and re-usable command, especially if you have e.g. 10 docker containers.

To deploy your application with Docker it must be packaged to it's own docker container. So, this means a docker image needs to be built from our JavaScript and Nodejs application and prepare it to be deployed on some environment. This will usually be done by an CD like Jenkins.
But in this video we will simulate what Jenkins does locally, building a docker image from our application locally.

In this video we will go through the following topics Docker Bind Mount and Volumes.

Since the docker container doesn't persist the data, there is a need for storing the files on the host and bind it to the container. The two ways of binding local/host files and folders to container are Bind Mount and Volumes.

We will see how to make use of these two concepts with example and also see the difference between bind mount and the volume. We will also discuss the switch -v and -m or --volume and --mount within docker run command.

Useful videos on this channel https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCRGR7nVzQCkzJcZpr5_8GVA

CMD and Entrypoint is an important concept in Dockerfile. It defines which default command to be executed when we run docker run. 

One of these instruction makes the docker container as an executable and the other one doesn't and also the command can be overridden in one case and not in the other.

Let's find out how with an example.

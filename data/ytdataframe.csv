JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in 2022. A lot of people are learning JavaScript to become front-end and/or back-end developers. 

I've designed this JavaScript tutorial for beginners to learn JavaScript from scratch. We'll start off by answering the frequently asked questions by beginners about JavaScript and shortly after we'll set up our development environment and start coding. 

Whether you're a beginner and want to learn to code, or you know any programming language and just want to learn JavaScript for web development, this tutorial helps you learn JavaScript fast. 

You don't need any prior experience with JavaScript or any other programming languages. Just watch this JavaScript tutorial to the end and you'll be writing JavaScript code in no time. 

If you want to become a front-end developer, you have to learn JavaScript. It is the programming language that every front-end developer must know. 

You can also use JavaScript on the back-end using Node. Node is a run-time environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser. With Node and Express (a popular JavaScript framework), you can build back-end of web and mobile applications. 

If you're looking for a crash course that helps you get started with JavaScript quickly, this course is for you.

29,YtebGVx-Fxw,StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Entropy (for data science) Clearly Explained!!!,"Entropy is a fundamental concept in Data Science because it shows up all over the place - from Decision Trees, to similarity metrics, to state of the art dimension reduction algorithms. It's also surprisingly simple, but often poorly explained. Traditionally the equation is presented with the expectation that you memorize it without thoroughly understanding what it means and where it came from. This video takes a very different approach by showing you, step-by-step, where this simple equation comes from, making it easy to remember (and derive), understand and explain to your friends at parties.

Web scraping refers to the extraction of data from a website quickly and accurately. Many people move onto selling their web scraping tools for money, either by building them as a chrome extension or API, or selling them to data capturing companies. So, the option to make money off this tool, is there for you too. 

Common questions:
- This tutorial assumes you have nodemon installed globally on your computer. If you do not, use command: npm i nodemon -g

Hello everyone and welcome to this online Coding Bootcamp. This Bootcamp has been designed specifically to make your coding journey easier by utilising all of @YouTube functionalities such as the Timestamps and Cards. 

We will be using the Timestamps to break up our Bootcamp into sections, so that you can easily navigate to and from each one using the description below. I will also be using Cards in order to direct you to an external project you can try, based on where we are in our Coding Journey.

I have also provided Code Sandboxes at the bottom for those stuck on code setup for the learning sections. I would advise to always type out the code to each exercise yourself, but as a safety net, they are provided as well. 

This 12hr+ Bootcamp is unsponsored and free and will always be free, so if you enjoy it please do give a big thumbs up and Subscribe!

50,FNYdBLwZ6cE,techTFQ,Learn how to write SQL Queries(Practice Complex SQL Queries),"Learn how to write SQL Queries(Practice Complex SQL Queries)
In this video, I will explain the thinking behind writing an SQL query. We shall go through five different complex SQL queries and try to solve it. The intention is to practice complex SQL queries.  The idea is to not just write SQL Queries but also to explain you the thinking behind how to choose a particular approach to solve a SQL query and how to choose different SQL functions or concepts to solve a problem.

Link to my blog where I have posted all of these SQL Queries:
https://techtfq.com/blog/learn-how-to-write-sql-queries-practice-complex-sql-queries

In this blog, you will find 9 SQL queries along with all the scripts to create the table, load data into these tables and also the solved SQL Queries. Out of these 9 SQL Queries, In this video, I have only solved 5 of them in order to reduce the video length.

Timeline:
00:00 Intro
01:36 Intro about the blog
03:25 SQL Query to fetch duplicate records from a table using window function
09:27 SQL Query to fetch doctors working in same hospital using self join
15:55 SQL Query to fetch users who logged in consecutively 3 or more times
25:10 SQL Query to fetch days when the temperature was very cold for consecutively 3 or more days
36:13 SQL Query to fetch top 2 accounts with maximum patients per month

Learning SQL Concepts and practically writing SQL queries are two different things. You may be familiar with the concept such as window function but until and unless you apply these concepts to write SQL queries, you will never truly understand SQL.

May of the queries I am going to solve in this video, I will be using window function such as LEAD, LAG, RANK, ROW_NUMBER etc. However, some of the queries are solved using self join, sub queries or inner joins.

The idea behind making this video, is to explain the thinking behind solving an SQL question. How to read the question and understand the problem statement and then analyze the existing data so that we can come up with an approach to write a query which can return the required result. These steps are very important in order for us to determine the different SQL concepts or functions to be used to solve the problem.

Please comment below your feedback if you liked this kind of video or if you have any doubts on any other queries mentioned in the blog.

We will cover what SQL is, why SQL is important, what SQL is used for, the syntax of SQL, and multiple examples of SQL. SQL is the standard language for interacting with and manipulating data in a relational database system, and is one of the most important concepts you can learn in programming. It allows you to create, read, update, and delete data which is something nearly every application will need to do.

80,nLw1RNvfElg,sentdex,Introduction - Data Analysis and Data Science with Python and Pandas,"Welcome to a data analysis tutorial with Python and the Pandas data analysis library.

The field of data analytics is quite large and what you might be aiming to do with it is likely to never match up exactly to any tutorial. With that in mind, I think the best way for us to approach learning data analysis with Python is simply by example. My plan here is to find some datasets and do some of the common data analysis tasks, using the Pandas package, to hopefully get you familiar enough with the package to work with it on your own.

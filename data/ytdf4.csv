And if you want to become a UX designer but don't know how to get started check out our video on that topic üëâ https://youtu.be/t0aCoqXKFOU"
MIND THE HEADPHONE,"Can we all just take a minute to appreciate how well produced this was? Great scenario, great lightning, great audio, great animations... Very nice!"
April Damaso,"Instead of constantly clicking to select an element (especially within a group), you can press CMD, hover over the element you want, and click. It will select that element and save you from multiple (and very annoying) clicks. This was a big game changer for me that I learned while using Sketch. Works on Figma too."
bootsmade4walking,Very helpful! I like how you assume that people are coming from a baseline-zero/beginner and go into detail without making it too confusing or lengthy. A true skill! :)
Isaac Somuah,This is insane. You literally saved me from taking an 11-hour course. I just needed the essentials to mock up my personal website. Thanks man!
Eaunic Martinez,The best tutorial I've ever watched so far! Easy to understand and very clear! You literally answered all my questions! Thank you so much!!!
Howard Tiersky,"Great tutorial! And I like how you said it straight - design isn‚Äôt a skill that‚Äôs perfected overnight. It‚Äôs developed by practice and more practice! It‚Äôs great to learn from others too. Figma seems to be a great site to start with - it‚Äôs free, user-friendly, and supports collaborative work! It‚Äôs a great tool for beginners."
Mary Creative Co.,It's a great tutorial for the beginners! Hope this tutorial will help many people to take the first steps in design üëç
ME & MY ADVENTURES,"I‚Äôm an architect, now I can learn how this design tool works easily. Design is a big process, software is a tool. Great video.‚ù§Ô∏èüëå"
Reb,Super helpful way to get started. I was getting a bit overwhelmed with the sheer volume of material when getting started in UI design. This gives me a way to start building. Thank you.
Myintthu Aung,You videos are incredibly helpful. You don't even know it. Unlike other tutorial videos where they talk for hours and hours and the audience don't get a point. You just go straight to the point and always explain in a way which works best for the beginners like myself. Thank you so much. Hope you get 1 million subscribers in no time!
Elle Pierson,"Such a well made video! You explained how to execute things in such an easier manner. I‚Äôm just learning Figma, and watching this video really helped jog my memory on a few of the tools I forgot about, so thank you! Can‚Äôt wait to start back up, and play around creating mock-ups."
Rosa Acevedo,This was an excellent tutorial! Thank you for providing a baseline for a non-design professional like myself.
ebaide85,This is awesome and quite inspiring for a fresher like me. every novice in UI/UX need to watch this. I'm almost giving up on designs until I found this video. Thank you for sharing this!
Francis Ikuerowo,"Thank you very much for this beginners' class. I learnt so much and I practised on my own. I got everything perfectly well.
You are a great tutor! Looking forward to watching more amazing videos of yours again."
janki mehta,I am just starting out as UI UX Designer and even the paid course on Udemy was nothing compared to what u showed in first few minutes‚Ä¶ thank you so so much for sharing your knowledge ‚Ä¶. I can‚Äôt wait to start a project and get the needed confidence üòä
Ludovico Sinz,"definitely a great ""getting started"" tutorial. Very well done, very clear. Thanks!"
Evgeny Pavlov,"great video, exactly what I was looking for. Many other instructors teach basics that are hardly applicable but learning the Figma UI while working with a template is a lot more inspiring. Also great that I learned where to find icons and stock images"
Carol Wohlwend,"Thank you! I'm starting a course in a few weeks and this makes me have a little more confidence, as I have no experience!  You are a great instructor!!!"
De Filmkijker,"Have been using Figma for some months figuring most out myself, but this was a good beginner tutorial. One tip to make picking colors quicker is just to press ""i"" on your keyboard, immediately will make the eyedropper pop up. Saves a few clicks!"
Peter Kim,"This is the exact ""learning by doing"" which is the fastest way to learn !  Thank you"
Manuel Diera,"Excellent video. Right to it and no fluff. Learned a ton, thanks!"
Kay Persephone,Great video! Straight to the point and easy to follow along. Perfect for beginners like myself. Thank you!
Stanciu Dragos,Amazing video! I have learned a ton from these 20 something minutes. It's not my first time trying to look into figma and tutorials/docs but it was all just so overwhelming before. Thanks a lot for the awesome explanations and clear tips.
Akinyemi Mathew,"This is a well-detailed Figma tutorial compare to others, nice animation, compelling audio, cool lightning and easy to understand approach without confusing me. I love how you do this. Kudos to you! :D"
Planet Joy,"wow I appreciate you guys creating this content so much!! I just started teaching myself UXD for over a week. Today I searched ""how to use Figma 101"" on Youtube and so happy this is the first video I clicked on. Very practical that I don't need to look around but can start to practice now. Please keep up the good work! Thank you!!!!!"
OLAJIRE AMINA,Really enjoyed the step-by-step guide. This is my first time doing anything visual and it was a great experience
yoondani,This a great tutorial for a beginner like me! I really liked how thorough you went with every step. Thank you so much :)
Sonny S.,This has given me so much confidence to get started - amazing tutorial and great tips!
Pheebs,This was soo helpful and has encouraged me to start using Figma. Really smooth and simple tutorial to follow. Thank you
Vita Education,Hi! Great easy to understand content. I have a question though. Let's say you work for a company with a team. What about if you don't have the exact icons you need or you are looking for? Do you design them yourself if skilled enough or is there any team member within the company that can do this graphic design? Thanks!
Katherine Carlson,This is a fantastic resource.  I gave up on another quick start Figma video because I didn't feel like I was accomplishing anything. By the end of the video I feel like I had learned a lot and actually made something (not just random shapes on a page). His method of teaching and use of templets makes very easy to learn by doing.
Feri Zar,"This is amazing, I followed your instructions step by step and I designed an online shop and I am really happy that I managed to design something even though it has a lot of problems. Thank you so much"
Martynas Verbusaitis,"That was amazing thank you, literally just what I needed to boost my confidence in Figma, now practice time :D"
Gigi Rodgers,"Can you make more of these in a video course? You just did the beginners intro to this platform, which was AH-MAZING (thank you! I just spent 1/2 day trying to learn from Skillshare classes, and those were a toss üòí)!! And the courses could be for a landing page, websites, and more! The way you explained how a newbie can dive right in - perfection. I want M-O-R-E!"
Nico Chan,This is great! Easy to follow and awesome tips ‚≠êÔ∏è
daniel ochei,"One of the best videos I have watched on getting started as a beginner, now it‚Äôs time to practice and replicate more figma designs, thank you!"
Basma Kamal,"Thank you so much Amr!!! how can we see more of Amr's work and instruction video's!!! he explains it very nicely and respect the time of the viewer without mocking or being sarcastic at the viewer, Amr truly inspired me to start my learning process just few days ago. please we need more of Amr video's."
Din Vin,Oh my goooood! You guys from AJ&Smart are so good at explaining everything. Thank you guys for providing us with such great content. It‚Äôs not just the content. The way you explain things gets all my attention. Thanks again ü•∞
Bart Christner,"Very clear, concise, enjoyable, informative, and well presented (video headshot and examples) ! Thanks!!"
Random Registrations,"Probably the best tutorial on any subject I've watched.  Great system for learning, great walkthrough, and great resources.  Subscribed!

Do you mind me asking what your production tools were for the video itself?  What did you use for screen capture and editing?

Nice work and very helpful.  Thank you!"
M Thompson,Love it! Thank you for the quick and easy tutorial.
Alice Vercelli,Thanks for your super clear explanation!I'm entering the ux/ui world after a five-months training course. I find your advice on copying other designs very helpful for beginners like me!So far I've used Adobe XD and Sketch...What do you think of them?(Love your channel ‚ù§Ô∏è)
Olatomide Awoyomi,"Thanks so much, you just saved tons of hours, I'm already a skilled graphic designer so this transition/explore has been made easy.

Cheers to AJ&Smart"
David Williamson,"Amazing video. Was very demotivated at the start. This video helps me understand the possibilities for this. Thank you so much, AJ!"

MJ Brown's VLOG,"Hi, I'm new to your channel and I'm an IT student and still confuse about my career, and I want to be a Web designer until I saw your portfolio now I'm more interested in designing and study coding as well, thank you so much for this, I've been watching so many videos and this is one of the best that I see.

Ashley James Music,"This is such a great video! Been binging your content - what can I say, I‚Äôm hooked!

Just curious; when creating a title to replicate the existing one ‚Äúnon-contact deliveries‚Äù why didn‚Äôt you just hold option and drag it to duplicate the content?"
Tufan,Very simple and informative for beginners. Thanks for content.
Matthew Pazaryna,I've been struggling to find the Figma starting point that works for me.  This was clear and very helpful.  Thank you!
Sugawara's wife,So interesting. I used the food delivery layout too! It's displaying a laptop webpage so I just made a mobile layout similar to the one in this vid! It looks like I'll explore for a while. üòÑ
Anja S.,"Thanks, that was very helpful and easy to understand :) Which video would you recommend to see next? I already designed a few prototypes for a university project using Figma and it is quite user friendly and easy to find images, icons and copy existing interfaces."
Alexander Stephen,"To individually round, a specific corner just hold ALT (PC) and round the desired corner only. Much better and faster."
Carlos Camargo,"Gostei muito!!! Grato, aprendi bastante!!!"
Ian Harrington,"Thank you for this, it was fantastic. I have a contract starting in two days, and the client uses Figma, which I never have before. I was pretty sure it would be similar to Sketch, and I'd therefore be fine, but I needed to be sure. Alas, it's way closer than I ever imagined it would be. Your tutorial gave me confidence to know I'll be able to hit the ground running."
Bahar Tahani,"Highly recommended, explained step by step, so clear and understandable."
Enjoy Maths,"Thank you very much. Great tutorial! 
I have a question. I hope it is not a stupid question: how one can use the designed frames in a real project? Do I have to make all steps with css? I know Figma gives the css code. But is there a way to export the design into a web project? In general: what is the next step when I finished all the design?"
Deep Shah,"This is actually great technique to learn any tool, I've learned XD using this technique with just a minor difference , I have placed reference Frame under the new Frame & reduce opacity of newer Frame to place each element at exact same spot."
sasidharan chandrasekaran,"Had an interest and was not sure whether to start with UI Designing, You have made me decide. Awesome teaching skills....Please continue the sameüî•. Thank you!"
Srileena Samaddar Saxena,Thank You so much! Softwares have always been a scary thing to me. The way you explained the basics of figma made it really easy. Thanks once again!!!
Matthew Tang,"Thank you AJ&Smart, this makes our digital marketers much more easier to get started with Web Design elements!"
Elisa Coccia,"thank you for this super good tutorial! One question: what should I use (from PC) to verify the distance between two elements? You say ""hold options"" but I have no clue about what it means"
Jennifer Arg√ºello,"üöÄ After failing to complete a few online courses on figma, I can see why this shorter form tutorial works for me. Thanks for such an amazing tutorial  that left me feeling like I learned a ton."
Rebecca Ade,"I found this extra helpful, like the way you went straight and this increased my enthusiasm to keep learning design. Thanks AJ"

bobcato,"Hi, thanks for the video - what apps/plug-ins did you use to capture the screen, and add your talking head as a circle?  What camera did you use? Links to gear and apps would be very helpful. Thanks."
Klax 6ix,"Hello! Your video is very educating and easier to grasp a novice, thanks for explaining in simpler terms. As a newbie in the world of UI, how do I go about creating a design that will fit all phone screen ratio? Cause am wondering one don't have to he clicking on a specific phone model all the time."

Radin Černý,"Summary for those who are not fans of long videos: The name of this video says ""Docker Tutorial for Beginners "", but the interesting part starts in time 6:30 and ends in 27:30. It is a very brief introduction to the theory of Docker - today is used also file docker-compose.yml for configuration but it is not mentioned. (I am a beginner so I was looking forward to know more) In time 6:20 the author says he will teach us Docker so we can use it as a Pro, but it probably was not meant for this video. In the rest of the video (53% of the total time) Linux commands are presented. Nice video, perfectly prepared, but the name could be more descriptive. But still I am giving thumb up."
Filipe Freire,"More a linux starter tutorial than a docker one, but good enough for beginners! The editing of the video is very well done too. :)"
Troll Gamer,"Hello mosh, i am a 15 year old kid and was learning python from your videos and want to thank you for making such cool videos as people in my class consider me a cool kid because i know way more python than they teach in school and because of your viewer friendly and simplified videos, its easy and fun to learn. Im looking forward to learn more languages and be a web developer in the future and the credit goes to you. Thanks a lot :D"
Ash Moore,"Hi Mosh, I just want to say thank you so much for providing such valuable content and presenting it in the most engaging and user friendly manner as you have. 
I learn so much more ffectively when watching videos that are very well put together, colourful, clearly spoken at a nice pace and a great balance with the music and sound effects etc :) I have seen too many dull and lifeless videos about topics which I am keen to learn more about, but have dropped very quickly due to the lack of engaging content and overall presentation from the videos. You have absolutely nailed this though and you have just earned yourself another subscriber :D keep up the amazing work!"
Irfan Shaikh,Excellent beginners tutorial. You have not jumped to complex things but ensured the basics are covered for anyone who wants to learn docker.
Ayesheh Ahrari Khalaf,Amazing course. I love how you are not above explaining everything single things to beginner level. Anyone with little programming background can enjoy this course. Thank you

Darth Killer,"34:00 yes on Windows (and DOS) the backslash notation is used for paths, but please note that the slash notation works too. Even in the terminal or in the explorer. Useful. ;)"
Anwesha Chatterjee,"Hello Mosh, Thank you so much for this course. Your way of teaching is too good. It gives us a clear understanding of the topic. Can you please create a course on Deploy docker containers on AWS?"

Peter Kovács,"Hey Mosh, in your Python guide for beginners (https://youtu.be/_uQrJ0TkZlc) , you mentioned the cheat sheet you created, however the link in the descrption seems to have expired or the file was removed. If you could update it, it would be great :)"
Jitesh Gamit,"You're just great at explaining things, Sir.
Can you please make a video on terminal and IDE configuration?"
Hardik Parmar,"I am currently learning  full stack development using mean stack and till now your videos have helped a lot achieving my goal. As I was looking for resources to learn docker and I found it a bit tricky so I paused for a while and continued learning full stack dev,  but then i found your video,  now I think i am at the right place and i am so excited to learn it from you.
I have not watched the whole video yet but i am sure that  i will enjoy it. even if i do not have enough knowledge of technology, i still watch your videos cause it really feels great to see things become easy suddenly.
Thank you for being on YouTube. I I would buy one of your videos in future when i will need to learn particular tech properly for industry perspective. 
Thanks again"

Tayeb Himel,This is one of the best docker course I have ever seen. Most of us who has no prior knowledge of Linux can greatly benefitted from this course. Thank you so much.
Mochi,By the way thank you so much! I tried doing Java and saw your video… then I realized I needed to know more about other subjects such as what is Linux or hyperv or cloud machines and how I can do much more backend developing because of you Java tutorial! Again thank you more widening my POV of IT!
Brent Stone Creative,"Mosh, thank you so much for this tutorial video on Docker. Your tutorial videos are well designed, have great graphics, the concepts are very well explained and really help the beginner. I'm taking a programming course through a college and we just started lectures on Docker yesterday. There were a lot of terms to digest and I had no idea what was referring to what or what was even being talked about. You've broken down the concepts into easy to understand language. Before I didn't even know what the purpose of Docker was. You've given it context. Thank you."
Emmanuel Peña Rodriguez,Wow... This introduction course is very helpful. Everything was well explained detail by detail. Hopefully I will be able to take the full course soon! Thanks @Mosh

Haneen,"I would really appreciate it if you could explain object oriented programming using real life examples where it could be implemented as most people explain it using analogies like ""a class is car and it's attributes are fuel"" or using an over simplified example. Thanks for making programming education more accessible!"
Obi Wan Kenobi,"Thank you very much Mosh. I  just started an education as a programmer and i had no idea about docker. But your explanations of the functions itself, and ur tutorial of actually using it was just great"

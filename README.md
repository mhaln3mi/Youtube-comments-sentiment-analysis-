# Youtube-comments-sentiment-analysis
Capstone project for MISK-DSI 

### Introduction
Sentiment Analysis is a technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative or neutral. Sentiment analysis is often performed on
textual data to help businesses monitor brand and product sentiment in customer feedback, and understand customer needs. In this project I will be using 
sentiment analysis on Youtube comments to help us determine if a video tutorial is good or bad.

### Data
I fetched the data using Youtube API, you can find the code I used to do that in the ```data``` folder.
